0	BLACKNESS

	 A sound is building. Like a living wind. A thousand screams in agony.

	 From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together quickly, forming the
	 Main Title against black:

						"EVIL DEAD"

	 Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II."

	 A SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us. And as the screams reach their sharp
	 crescendo the title zooms through us.

	 FADE IN:

1	ANGLE - STOP MOTION ANIMATION

	 Whisping smoke against a black background. EERIE MUSIC. In the
	 distance, through the smoke, a small object. It fans toward us
	 quickly, filling the frame. It is an ancient skin covered volume, with
	 the outline of a human face on it's cover. This is the Book of the
	 Dead.

						NARRATOR
			   Legend has it, that it was written
			   by the dark ones: NECRONOMICON EX
			   MORTES; Roughly translated...The
			   Book of the Dead.

	 The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its skin binding and
	 leans toward the camera. EYES on the book blink open and peer at us.
	 It's mouth opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races into the
	 blackness of the screaming mouth.

						NARRATOR
			   To trace the origin of the Book, we
			   must go back...back...to a day when
			   spirits ruled the earth.

	 Wispy shapes of animated ghosts move through this vortex, coming
	 toward the CAMERA with WAILING and MOANING and then are gone.

						NARRATOR
			   When the seas ran red with blood.

	 A raging ocean of blood. Great waves rise and swell as if before a

			   It was this blood that was used to
			   ink the book.

	 IN BG

	 Through animation, the blank pages of the Book are scripted in a
	 strange hieroglyphic by an invisible hand.

	 Faster and faster the pages turn on the Book as the blood red ink is
	 scrawled across them. The pages flip furiously until the Book snaps
	 shut, reveal ing its gruesome face on the cover.

	 The book flaps violently away from camera.

						NARRATOR (V.O.)
			   The Book of the Dead was last seen
			   in 1300 A.D.

5	EXT. KANDAR CASTLE - DUSK - 4 WARRIORS - 4 HORSES

	 CAMERA panning down to reveal a magnificent newly built castle of
	 stone. Bright banners fly from its turrets. An ox grazes nearby. 4
	 Warriors on horseback in the BG.

						NARRATOR (V.O.)
			   It was then that the dark spirits
			   again rose up to battle the living.

	 The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart. A red glow
	 and smoke pour from the growing crevice. Something evil is being
	 unleashed. A strong wind kicks up blowing sand in a furious rage.

5A    EXT. KANDAR CASTLE - DUSK - TRACKING SHOT - ASH

	 Through the blowing silt, a lone figure appears. An image of power and
	 light. His clothing is ragged, and he holds what appears to be a
	 jagged toothed long sword. Two massive columns of stone stand on
	 either side. CAMERA slowly moves closer, but his face is still hidden
	 by the darkness and blowing sands.

						NARRATOR (V.O.)
			   It is said that a hero came from the
			   sky. A man who defeated this evi and
			   buried the Book in the Castle of
			   Kandar. And there it lay for 700
			   years...

										    DISSOLVE THRU TO:

6	EXT. CASTLE OF KAN DAR - DAY - RUINS

	 As the raging dust storm clears to reveal the same castle which we saw
	 earlier, but now, in a ruined state. It has aged 700 years. The ox is
	 gone. Now only its petrified skeletal remains stand in a weathered
	 heap.

						NARRATOR (V.O.)
			   ...Waiting.

	 A four wheel drive vehicle roars PAST THE CAMERA and toward the
	 castle.

7	INT. CASTLE OF KAN DAR - DAY - (STUDIO) - TRACKING SHOT

	 The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the Dead as it sits in
	 the darkness of the stone tomb. Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER,
	 an ancient knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a weasel.
	 They rest upon a small pedestal covered with cobwebs. Prominently
	 displayed on the stone wall, a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky"
	 holding his unusual jagged edged weapon.

						NARRATOR (V.O.)
			   And then...

	 The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard, and a large stone
	 is swung open on a secret hinge in the wall behind the book. Wind
	 sweeps in through the tomb, along with the blinding light from
	 outside. A sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
	 doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds, illuminating his
	 face. This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND KNOWBY. An intelligent, grey bearded
	 man in his late fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
	 been protecting him from the sand. He stares at the Book, awestruck.

	 Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of the tomb. The
	 first is a large school-marmish woman, the wife of Raymond Knowby,
	 HENRIETTA. She moves to Raymond's side and takes his hand. Immediately
	 behind her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years old,
	 strong stance and beautiful. Behind her a handsome looking man, ED
	 GETLY, enters the tomb. He moves to Annie's side. They exchange
	 excited glances. The CAMERA PANS down to the Book.

9	EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - LONG SHOT

	 An old log cabin, built in the valley of a dark forest. A great wind
	 billows fog about the place.

						NARRATOR (V.O.)
			   Professor Raymond Knowby and his
			   wife, HENRIETTA, brought the book to
			   a small cabin where they could study
			   it undisturbed.

10    INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

	 Professor Raymond Knowby sits at a writing desk and transcribes
	 passages from the Book of the Dead. A small framed photograph of his
	 daughter Annie sits upon the table. Behind him, HENRIETTA sits
	 knitting in a rocking chair.

11    CLOSE SHOT - RAYMOND

	 He speaks the phonetic pronunciation of completed sentences into the
	 microphone of a tape recorder.

						RAYMOND
			   Kanda...Es-trata...Ta-toon...Hazan
			   sobar...Ear-Grets, Gat...Nos-feratos
			   ...Amantos...Kanda!

	 The sound of RAYMOND reciting the passages is faded down AS THE CAMERA
	 SLOWLY TRACKS away from RAYMOND and over to HENRIETTA as she rocks
	 back into the darkness and forward into the light. As she rocks
	 forward into the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her
	 eyes have changed to a milky white. She continues to knit.

13    INT. CABIN CELLAR - NIGHT (STUDIO)

	 A dank fruit cellar with shelves of half-rotten preserves. Raymond has
	 his back to the stone wall. He is dictating into the tape recorder,
	 sweating and distraught.

						RAYMOND
			   It has only been a few hours since
			   I've translated and spoke aloud the
			   first of the demon resurrection
			   passages from the Book of the Dead.

	 The sound of heavy footsteps. Dust drifts down INTO FRAME. Raymond
	 looks up to the ceiling of the cellar. It is also the floor to the
	 main room of the cabin. He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette
	 paces the floor above him. And then, the footsteps halt.

						RAYMOND
			   And now, I fear that my wife has
			   become host to a Kandarian demon.
			   May God forgive me for what I have
			   unleashed onto this earth.

13Y   REVERSE ACTION

	 The milky eyed possessed figure of HENRIETTA jolts quickly into the
	 frame, and shrieks in the voice of a demon! Raymond Knowby screams. He
	 drops the microphone.

13X   CLOSE SHOT - TAPE RECORDER

	 As the microphone falls atop it. High pitched feed-back screams from
	 the speaker.

13A   CLOSE SHOT - RAYMOND

	 Screaming in terror.

13B   CLOSER - RAYMOND

	 His fearful eyes fill the screen as the scream continues.

13C   EXTREME C.U. - RAYMOND'S EYE

	 Darting about wildly and the scream continues.

										    DISSOLVE THRU TO:

14    INT. DARK TUNNEL - DAY - ROUNDY-ROUNDY - CAMERA MOUNTED ATOP VAN

	 CAMERA MOVING swiftly down a dark tunnel. A light at the end growing
	 closer. The SOUND of AIR RUSHING BY. The Delta 88 Oldsmobile comes
	 ROARING out of the tunnel with a BLAST of AIR, and the sound of loud
	 rock and roll music.

						NARRATOR (V.O.)
			   It was one week later that a group
			   of college students came to the
			   cabin.

14A   EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT

	 The Delta 88 Oldsmobile parked out front. Fog roars past the place. We
	 faintly hear waltz music from within. The silhouette of a woman sweeps
	 by the rear bedroom window.

14B   INT. CABIN - REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT - ASH AND LINDA

	 LINDA, an attractive college student, is waltzing in the semi darkness
	 of the bedroom. She wears a "Michigan State University" sweatshirt.
	 She hums melodically to the music as she moves. Around her neck is
	 draped a delicate silver necklace.

14C   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA

	 A handsome young man, ASH, is playing the waltz music on an old wooden
	 piano. Linda dances behind him. Ash is not a very good pianist, and
	 can only plunk out the melody with two fingers.

						LINDA
			   Ash, what's that you're playing?

						ASH
			   Our song.

	 Ash begins to play faster.

14D   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA

	 As she picks up the tempo, spinning and laughing, until finally Ash
	 moves to her, halting her in mid spin.

14E   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA

	 Out of breath, hair tousled across her eyes, she stares deeply into
	 Ash's eyes. Her lips, parted, in a sensual manner.

14F   CLOSE SHOT - ASH

	 He returns her stare, lost in her beauty. He pulls her close.

						LINDA
			   Ow!

14G   SHE PULLS AWAY SUDDENLY

	 And looks down to the tiny silver necklace that she wears about her
	 neck.

14H   CLOSE SHOT - NECKLACE

	 In its center is a magnifying glass.

14I   MEDIUM SHOT - LINDA AND ASH - TULIP CRANE

	 She looks from the necklace to Ash.

						LINDA
			   I really love it. I'll never take it
			   off.

	 They kiss and now begin to dance together, to the haunting waltz
	 melody that sweeps up upon the soundtrack.

						NARRATOR (V.O.)
			   It was in the cabin's cellar that
			   they found the Professor's tape
			   recorder, and the Book of the Dead.

14J   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

	 CAMERA tracks in toward the trap door. It opens by itself as we move

	 Raymond Knowby's tape recorder, tapes, the Kandarian dagger and...

	 ...the shattered photograph of Annie Knowby and the Book of the Dead.

17    LONG SHOT - INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM

	 The group of students sit about the fire as they listen to the tape
	 recorder. Coming from the speaker is the voice of Raymond Knowby
	 reciting the demon resurrection passage.

						PROFESSOR KNOWBY
				    (on tape)
			   ...Nos-Feratos...Amantos...Kanda!

20    EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

	 The cabin is in the distance. In the foreground the earth begins to
	 swell, then rips apart as a red glow emanates from beneath. Something
	 evil is being unleashed.

						NARRATOR (V.O.)
			   One by one, they fell to the
			   possession of the dark spirits.

21    OMIT

22    EXT. HILLSIDE - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT - LINDA

	 Her eyes pop open. They are bone white. She has fallen to the
	 possession.

22A   EXT. HILLSIDE - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT - ASH AND LINDA

	 Possessed Linda is coming after Ash. Ash back peddles, stumbles and
	 falls.

22B   ANGLE - ASH ON GROUND

	 As the Shadow of approaching Linda envelops Ash, he picks up a shovel
	 from the ground.

22C   LINDA LEAPS OVER THE CAMERA, TOWARD HIM.

	 Ash enters the cabin. He sees The Book of the Dead and tosses it onto
	 the flames.

27    CLOSE SHOT - MELTDOWN - MAIN ROOM (STUDIO) - STOP MOTION ANIMATION

	 A possessed demon begins to wither and melt. Flesh shrinks away from
	 its skull and dissolves to nothing.

						NARRATOR (V.O.)
			   But the evil that had been
			   resurrected from it, lives on.

28    CLOSE SHOT - BOOK IN FIREPLACE - STOP MOTION ANIMATION

31    EXT. CABIN - DAWN - RECREATION OF THE FINAL SHOT OF EVIL DEAD I

	 We are racing forward. We have taken the POV of an EVIL ENTITY as it
	 glides with dark purpose through a section of woods. It approaches the
	 rear door of the cabin. The door is torn violently open. The next door
	 falls away from us. We approach the front door. SLAM! It jigsaws in
	 two and we are again outside, now in front of the cabin. Ash is seen
	 in the distance. He is staggering away, his back to us as we race at
	 him. He turns suddenly towards CAMERA and screams.

32    EXT. WOODS - DAWN - INTERVOLOMETER STOP MOTION/CRANE - SAM-O-CAM

	 The final shot of Evil Dead I has a new ending; an extension. Ash is
	 caught by an invisible grip. "G" force is distorting Ash's face as he
	 is rocketed backwards. He is swept hand over foot through the air. He
	 reaches the edge of the woods and begins tearing through the branches
	 and smaller trees, clearing a path with his body. He finally slams
	 into a large ungiving tree trunk and he is knocked unconscious.

33    WIDE SHOT - LOOKING UPWARD - ASH - DUMMY - DAWN

	 As he falls from the tree branch and plummets towards the earth.

34    ASH'S POV - (CRANING DOWNWARD) - UNDERCRANKED - DAWN

	 A puddle of mud below, which rushes up upon us quickly.

35    MED. SHOT - MUD PUDDLE - ASH

	 As his head splashes down into the muddy water.

36    CLOSE SHOT - ASH - DAWN

	 He lifts his face from the mud, and turns toward us. His eyes have
	 gone white. His skin is now a pale color, his lips, jet black. He is
	 Possessed. A bright edge of morning sunlight moves across his face. He
	 turns his beastly face skyward.

37    EXT. RIDGE - DAY (STUDIO) - MATTE PAINTING - LONG SHOT - THE SUN
	 (Miniature)

	 Rising over a mountain ridge. Sunlight streaming through a gaping hole
	 in the parting clouds, in bright shafts. It pours through the trees.

41A   EXT. WOODS - DAWN

	 Ash, no longer possessed, collapses into the mud puddle, unconscious.

41B   EXT. WOODS - DAY - REVERSE ACTION - FOG - 3 ANGLES

	 Streams of morning sunlight pierce the darkness of the woods. We hear
	 the shriek of demons. The sound of SIZZLING. A great wind blows back
	 fog into the darker sections of the woods. The scene grows brighter
	 and the peaceful sounds of morning are faded up.

										    DISSOLVE THRU TO:

42    EXT. WOODS - DAY - WIDE SHOT - ASH

	 As he lies unconscious. Time passes.

43    CLOSE SHOT - ASH - CRANE - UNDERCRANKED

	 His eyes open. They stare blankly up at the sky. Then fear registers
	 and we CRANE BACK QUICKLY, revealing a vast area of empty woods around
	 Ash.

44    MEDIUM SHOT - ASH

	 He sits up slowly into frame, looking fearfully about.

45    ASH'S POV

	 Panning the battered cabin And sections of the woods. All is peaceful.
	 The sound of birds tweeting.

46    CLOSE SHOT - ASH

						ASH (V.0.)
			   It's gone.

	 He looks up to the sky.

47    EXT. RIDGE - DAY - (STUDIO) - MATTE PAINTING - LONG SHOT - THE SUN -

51    CLOSE SHOT - ASH

	 As he nods to himself, then suddenly glances up beyond the CAMERA.

52    EXT. CABIN - DAY - MITCHELL CAMERA - ASH'S POV - THE CABIN

	 A perfectly normal log cabin with one exception; superimposed over the
	 front of the place is...

52P   PLATE FOR PREVIOUS SCENE - (BLACK STUDIO) - MITCHELL CAMERA

	 A hideous human skull with living eyeballs that stare out at us with
	 evil malice. The eyes stare out from the two dark windows. The dark
	 nose area is the open doorway, and the rotted teeth of the skull are
	 the whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin. Then it fades,
	 leaving only the cabin.

53    EXT. WOODS - DAY - WIND FAN - CLOSE SHOT - ASH - MUD PUDDLE

	 He shudders uncontrollably as he picks himself up from the mud.

	 Ash MOVES INTO A CLOSE UP. His eyes shift back and forth like a
	 trapped animal as he looks about for a means of escape. He spots
	 something.

54    EXT. CABIN - DAY - ASH'S POV - THE DELTA 88 OLDSMOBILE

	 Parked in front of the cabin.

55    EXT. WOODS -DAY - CLOSE SHOT - ASH

	 He shifts his glance from the car to the road.

56    EXT. ROAD - DRIVEWAY TO CABIN - DAY

	 A narrow dirt road cutting through the woods. Then, the Delta 88 roars
	 down it, and past the CAMERA. It kicks up dust and gravel.

57    INT. DELTA 88 - DAY - (CAR MOUNT)

	 Ash is driving. He wipes the mud and blood from his face with a rag.
	 As he pulls the rag away, his face forms a sudden look of horror as he
	 sees:

58    EXT. BRIDGE - DAY (STUDIO MINIATURE W/BACKDROP) - CAR'S POV - TRACKING
	 SHOT - STOP MOTION ANIMATION

	 A GIANT STEEL HAND LOOMS towards us. It is the twisted remains of the
	 steel and wood bridge that crossed a great mountain chasm. A LOUD
	 SCREECH of brakes is heard on the soundtrack on this cut.

59    EXT. BRIDGE SIDE I - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT - DELTA 88 - PARTIAL BRIDGE SET

	 As it pulls to a halt. Ash steps quietly from the car. He looks at the
	 bridge.

60    EXT. BRIDGE - DAY (STUDIO MINIATURE W/BACKDROP) - ASH'S POV - BRIDGE

	 A sign hangs from the twisted girders. It reads: "DANGEROUS BRIDGE - 2
	 TON WEIGHT LIMIT - CROSS AT OWN RISK." Beyond this we see the twisted
	 remnants of the former bridge and the rock cliffs far away on the
	 other side.

60A   EXT. BRIDGE SIDE I - DAY - MITCHELL CAMERA - FROM RAVINE, LOOKING
	 UPWARD AT ASH AND DELTA (5 FRAMINGS)

	 Ash gapes at the uncrossable chasm.

	 The sun is now resting on the horizon. Lower than it was before. It is
	 BLOOD RED, and sets in the course of seven seconds.

62    INT. STUDIO (BLUE SCREEN) - MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - PULLING BACK

	 To reveal Ash as he looks from the surlset, to the ruined bridge, to
	 the road behind him. He moves in halting steps, not knowing which way
	 to turn.

	 Ash opens his mouth, draws in his breath, and just as he begins to
	 scream, we CUT TO:

62P2  OMIT

63    EXT. BRIDGE - TWILIGHT - POV OF EVIL FORCE - 3 CAMERAS - BREAKAWAY
	 TREES

	 As it rises up from what appears to be the mountain chasm and reveals
	 the opposite side of the twisted girders which form the "Giant Hand."
	 It spots Ash immediately beyond. It moves swiftly towaad him. Ash
	 looks up, sensing the evil and darts into the Delta 88. The FORCE
	 moves through the twisted girders, pushing them away violently and
	 races towaad the car.

	 The Delta starts up and peels off. The Evil Force just misses it. The
	 car doesn't have the room to complete the one hundred and eighty
	 degree turn necessary to head back down the road the way it originally
	 came, and is forced into a line of break-away trees which explode into
	 sawdust as the front of the Delta 88 rips through them. The car
	 swerves onto the road, headed back toward the cabin.

	 As the broken bits of tree slam against his windshield.

65    CLOSE SHOT - CAR RADIO/TAPE DECK

70    INT. DELTA 88 - NIGHT - UNDERCRANKED - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER

	 Looking through the windshield, as branches beat and smash themselves
	 against the windshield, obscuring our vision of the "Road" ahead. Our
	 view suddenly clears, revealing a large tree that looms directly
	 ahead.

71    CLOSE SHOT - ASH

	 Swerving the wheel.

76A   ANGLE - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER

	 As he runs toward the cabin. (Actually he is running in place in the

	 more he runs, the farther away from the cabin he gets.

77    POV - EVIL FORCE - IMO CAMERA MOUNTED ON LONG POLE AND TRUCK - 3
	 DELTAS - "RAM-O-CAM"

	 It approaches the rear of the Delta, rips through the back window,
	 moves through the car's interior, music still blasting, and bursts out
	 the remains of the front windshield. We move through the steam of the
	 radiator and approach Ash as he runs for the cabin.

78    CLOSE SHOT - ASH

	 As he runs toward the cabin not making much progress as though caught
	 running in a nightmare. He shakes his head "No."

78A   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET AS THEY RUN

79    ANGLE - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER

	 Now closer to the cabin. (Again, Ash is running in place in the camera
	 car as it slowly backs away from the cabin.)

	 shut. Ash retreats into the rear hallway, and swings the hallway door
	 shut. We race right up to the door and it shatters into many pieces as
	 we glide forward.

83    INT. CABIN - STUDIO - "MAZE SHOT" - FORCE POV

	 Camera moves through the main room and up to the Hallway door. It
	 shatters in front of us. We close in on Ash as he races down the
	 hallway. We lose him as he swings into the back bedroom of the cabin
	 and slams the door behind him. We rip through this door and enter the
	 rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling for the door to the middle
	 bedroom, which we approach and he swings shut in our face. We rip
	 through to reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway. We follow him
	 through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the Hallway. We
	 round the corner after him and see that Ash has led us into the main
	 room, but there is not a trace of him. We look about for him, but he
	 is gone. The hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves.

84    INT./EXT. CABIN - LOCATION - POV EVIL FORCE

	 The force begins to pull back with an ever-increasing speed, out the
	 front door of the cabin, and deep into the blackness of the woods.

85    INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

	 A static shot of the fireplace. All is quiet. Smoke from the near dead
	 fire wafts up the chimney. We hold on this for a moment.

85A   ANGLE - MIDDLE BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT

	 A static shot of a closet with it's doof half open. The door begins to
	 swing slightly open, revealing a rack of clothes inside. We hold on
	 this for a moment.

85B   ANGLE - CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT

	 A writing desk with some papers atop it. They begin to tremble and
	 finally blow away from the light breeze that sweeps through the cabin.
	 The CAMERA PANS down from this desk to reveal a trap door in the floor
	 of the main room. The trap door to the cellar. It is raised up on its
	 hinge an inch or so and in that slight space between the trap door and
	 the floor we see Ash's eyes, looking cautiously about. He breathes a
	 sigh of relief.

86    EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	 The cabin in the distance. Fog rolls past.

	 The airplane rolls to a halt. A man wearing a jumpsuit ties the
	 airplane off and blocks the wheels while a redcap opens the hatch and
	 helps out Annie Knowby. She carries a glass case in her hand as she
	 moves toward us. Behind her five other passengers emerge from the
	 Plane. Ed approaches Annie.

						ED
			   Annie!

						ANNIE

			   Hi.

	 They embrace and kiss.

						ED
			   How'd everything go on the

						ANNIE
			   Terrific. I found the additional

			   Tonight. Is everything all set with

						ED
			   Should be, but I haven't spoken to
			   him in a week, what with no phone in
			   that cabin. Take us about an hour to
			   get there.

	 They arrive at the parking lot. Two new, sharp looking cheverolets and
	 Ed's old style cheverolet.

						ED
			   We'll take my car.

	 Ed opens the car trunk. Behind him a redcap pulls up a large steamer
	 trunk on a hand dolly. Ed and the redcap hoist the steamer up into the
	 car's trunk.

						ED
			   Annie, you hinted in your telegram
			   that your father was on to something
			   with the first part of his
			   translations. What's the big
			   mystery? What has he found in The

151   EXT. WOODS/CABIN - W/ ASH - NIGHT - CHEVROLET CAR TRUNK

	 CAMERA has taken the POV of the evil force as it glides eerily through
	 the woods, around trees and over rotted stumps. It moves over a rise
	 revealing a clear view of the boarded cabin in the distance. It
	 approaches. It moves to the window, and peering through the cracks in
	 the boards we see Ash asleep in the rocking chair.

152   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

	 Camera begins on hammer, nails, and planking which lay upon the cabin
	 floor. Camera pans to window #1. It is boarded up tight. Camera pans
	 to door. It is repaired. Camera pans to Ash who sleeps in the rocking
	 chair in front of another boarded window.

	 Ash awakens suddenly, sensing something, the shotgun clutched in his
	 lap. He lifts his head and turns to a whispering musical sound. Harp
	 like music. It is coming from the back bedroom of the cabin.

	 enters the room he halts his gaze on the old wooden piano.

155   INT. CABIN/REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT - ASH

	 As he moves to the piano. The sound is coming from within. Suddenly,
	 the piano begins to play by itself! Ash draws back from it. It plays a
	 waltz. Now the piano music mixing with the harp-like strings. The
	 radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of musical steam,
	 adding a wind section to this strange orchestra.

156   CLOSE SHOT - ASH

	 As he listens to this haunting version of a waltz melody. He
	 recognizes the music. It is the same music that Ash had played
	 earlier, when Linda was dancing.

157   CLOSE SHOT - PIANO AND RADIATOR

	 As steam spouts from the radiator pipes. As the piano keys depress and
	 release themselves. The melody grows louder.

152   CLOSE SHOT - ASH

	 As he lowers his head. His horror gives way to sadness.
 
	 From his pocket he removes Linda's delicate silver locket that dangles
	 from the end of a chain. In the locket's center is a magnifying glass.
	 He stares mournfully into the glass. BANG! He looks up sharply toward
	 the main room.

	 The WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting corpse that
	 was Linda begins to dance, bending and swaying as she sweeps
	 gracefully through the evening fog. A waltz of the dead.

	 The style of dance begins to change. It becomes more primitive. The
	 music changes to a more primal beat. The dance becomes sexually
	 oriented. Erotic, with sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

	 Confused. Wondering what has happened to the chainsaw. Behind him, the

	 head. Ash is screaming.

187D  MEDIUM SHOT

	 The blade of the chainsaw swings upward and arcs back into headless
	 Linda, imbedding itself in her neck. She goes nuts as the chainsaw
	 bites its way into her chest cavity. She spins wildly about the room

						ASH
			   Eat chainsaw.
 
	 He brings down the spinning blade. And moves past the CAMERA and

	 they are covered in Linda's blood.

	 He wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying to rid himself of

	 own accord.

190   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH

	 In a confused state as he backs away from the chair and into the wall.

	 quickly over the CAMERA, trapping the hand within.

	 "Farewell to Arms".

231   FIREPLACE

	 Ash raises a red hot fireplace shovel that had been resting upon the
	 coals. He grits his teeth.

232   ANGLE

	 movement.

259   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL

264   CLOSE SHOT - ASH

	 For the first time feeling victorious. As Ash continues to stare at
	 the hole, his expression changes to one of perplexity.

265   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS

	 The trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow, then, even this
	 volume of blood multiplies. It is forced out of the wall with a
	 greater and greater pressure until blood pours from the wall like a
	 fire hose.

266   CLOSE SHOT - ASH

	 Horrified, he spins his glance to the sound of more gushing liquid. He
	 is hit in the face with a geyser of deep red blood.

	 The 2nd and 3rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood in a geyser.
	 The CAMERA PANS over to the 4th of the holes. This, too, is an
	 eruption of blood. The blood changes in color to a black fluid, then
	 yellow, then turquoise.

268   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS

	 Screaming as he looks down at his wrist. CAMERA PANS DOWN to it. The
	 severed wrist begins dribbling blood. Then in a burst, it too, erupts
	 in a hellish fire hose. It spouts blood under such great pressure that
	 ASH is driven against the walls of the cabin because of it.

269   MED. SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS

	 We follow him as he slams from one wall into another.

270   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS

	 In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it all suddenly
	 stops. The cabin is again deadly quiet. ASH, soaked in blood and
	 shivering, waits. For what, he's not sure.

271   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH

	 As he slowly backs away from the walls and sits upon the three legged
	 chair. It shatters beneath him, dumping him on his butt.

	 They follow his gaze. The CAMERA PANS TO Ash. He stands alone on a
	 small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering shotgun. He looks about
	 dazedly. He tries to get his bearings.

692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS

	 They falter. Unsure of how to react to this strange man, who a moment
	 before was pronounced a Deadite. From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls
	 out:

						WARRIOR #1
			   Hail he, who has come from the sky,
			   to deliver us from the terrors of
			   the deadites!

						WARRIOR #4
			   Hail!

						WARRIOR #5
			   Hail!

	 The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors bow. Then
	 twenty. Then fifty. All remove their helmets and kneel silently in the
	 dust.

	 Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS. Ash stands frozen. Terrified,
	 unsure of where or when he is. Knowing only for the present, he is
	 alive.

	 As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a familiar pose. It is
	 the same image of the "Hero from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the
	 film. The strange "jagged edged long sword" is Ash's chainsaw.

	 The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle rears up
	 INTO FRAME. It is seen to be the castle of Kandar. The same castle we
	 saw in the begining of the film. Now, however, the castle is not a
	 ruin, but brand new. As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash,
	 the title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by the distant
	 ROAR of some dying animal: The SCREEN cuts to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS
	 BOOM.
