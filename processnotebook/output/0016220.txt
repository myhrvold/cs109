    (The following foreword is to be presented on a moving scroll that
    moves up)
    
    _FOREWORD_		
    			Dear patrons of the Silent Drama ...
    			In this present era of discovery and invention
    			Spiritualism and other psychic phenomena are scoffed
    			at by the masses in general. Therefore, we ask you
    			to bear with us while we unfold for your entertain-
    			ment, the story of the "Opera Ghost" which really
    			did exist according to the memoirs of the late M.
    			Faure, Chief of the Paris Secret Police, whose
    			weird tale of a criminal investigation which lead
    			him to an opaque veil that cloaked the supernatural
    			now lies in the archives of the National Academy
    			of Music in the French Capitol.
    
    						_FADE OUT_
    
    
    1.			FADE IN
    			CLOSE SHOT on a volume which rests on a rich 
    			velvet table scarf-- on the book is the title in
    			French --MEMOIRES OF M. FAURE, CHIEF OF THE PARIS 
    			SECRET POLICE. As the French letters dissolve into
    			English and we play long enough to identify, a
    			hand enters scene and opens volume to the preface.
    
    
    2.			CLOSE VIEW of the first page of the Preface which reads:
    			           To whom it may concern:-
    			Before unfolding my hair-raising experience in
    			making an investigation of the murderous crimes at-
    			tributed to the "Opera Ghost" it will be necessary
    			for me to relate a few interesting facts concerning
    			the Paris Opera house, where the Ghost existed.
    			       The Paris Opera house was conceived by Louis
    			Napoleon III, after an unsuccessful attempt to
    			duplicate the world power of his illustrious uncle,
    			the great Napoleon, as a sop to his suffering and 
    			war-ridden subjects.
    			(a hand turns the page over revealing a picture of
    			Louis Napoleon III, as the military emperor)
    			        It was designed and executed by that
    			celebrated architect, Jean Louis Charles Garnier, who
    			later built the Forum of Trajan and the Temple of
    			Vesta in Rome--and the Casino at Monte Carlo.
    			(A hand turns the page over revealing a picture of
    			Jean Louis Charles Garnier)
    			       No European capital possesses an opera house
    			so comprehensive in plan and execution, nor can
    			boast an edifice so vast and splendid.
    			(A hand turns the page over revealing a picture of
    			the Paris Opera house to show its magnitude and
    			decorative design.)
    			       Its construction began in 1851, and was es-
    			timated to cost thirty-five million francs, and it
    			required twelve years for completion. It contains
    			583 dressing rooms, 2551 doors and 7893 keys; 14
    			furnaces and 450 grates; 16 miles of gas pipe, 9
    			reservoirs and two tanks holding 22,222 gallons of
    			water.
    			(A hand turns the page over and we read further)
    			      During the revolution of 1870, the con-
    			struction was halted for a time, when Napoleon III 
    			lost his throne and the present Republic of France 
    			was declared.
    			       It was during those dark days of bloodshed 
    			that the building was used as a military head-
    			quarters. Its vast cellars turned into dungeons
    			for prisoners, and secret passages and torture
    			chambers installed to satisfy the blood lust of a 
    			crazed populace.
    			(A hand turns the page over revealing the first 
    			page of M. Faure's memoirs.)
    			        Many were the skeptics who scoffed at the
    			idea of the "Opera Ghost" but the few upon whose
    			word I could rely believed in its existence;
    			vowing that the opera house bore a curse, dating
    			back to the time when the Second Commune carried on
    			a wholesale massacre of the Nobility in the dark 
    			cellars. LAP DISSOLVE INTO:
    
    
    3.			EXT. PARIS OPERA HOUSE.
    
    			It is night and under the gas lights we see the
    			arrival of the nobility and the elite of Paris in
    			carriages. There are a throng of curious bystanders
    			of both sexes eager to see the aristocracy.
    
    
    4.			INT GRAND STAIRCASE  #1. . . AMBER
    
    			This is a cross shot of the staircase, something of
    			the view shows in the first illustration in the book.
    			The scene presents a gorgeous picture. Circulating
    			on the stairway are the elite, the wealthy, the aris-
    			tocratic, the military, the fashionable of Paris.
    			The carriage and general manner of the people is very
    			light and informal. Some wear opera hats tilted at
    			an angle, and others not. The men, women, officers
    			and attendants of the opera are dressed for the
    			period of approximately 1890. The women are
    			beautifully gowned as the Paris Grand Opera is the
    			show place of the fashionable world. The number of
    			people will be governed by what is required to
    			comfortably fill the big set. Crowds will also be
    			seen moving in the four galleries, while others will
    			circulate upon the staircases which lead downward at
    			either side of the main stairs. It is a scene of
    			gaiety and laughter.
    
    
    5.			INT. GRAND STAIRCASE  #2. . AMBER.
    
    			This is a longer shot taking in the set -- up to
    			and including the third gallery. This is as high
    			up as the cornice. In this shot the galleries are
    			seen filled with a gay throng. A general movement of
    			exit toward the auditorium begins.
    
    
    6.			INT GRAND STAIRCASE  #3 . .AMBER
    
    			This is the entire grand staircase set, including
    			the dome. There are people now seen in the fourth
    			gallery. The general movement of the crowd toward
    			the auditorium continues.
    
    
    7.			INT. AUDITORIUM.
    			LONG SHOT. . AMBER.
    
    			It is the hour before the overture and first
    			curtain of the opera Faust --The curtain is down
    			and people are entering from both side entrances,
    			and the entrance below the Portierre. The
    			aisles are crowded, not only with those seeking
    			their seats, but also with groups. All are laughing
    			and talking. The atmosphere is free and informal.
    			Many are standing or lounging against the seats,
    			gossiping with acquaintances a few seats distant.
    			The chandelier is a blaze of light. The musicians
    			(71 including the director) are filling in and
    			taking their places in the orchestra pit. There is
    			life and a fluttering of motion in all of the boxes
    			except Box Five and one on the opposite side.
    
    
    8.			A LONG SHOT. .AMBER
    
    			As people are seen from high, shooting down upon
    			the orchestra and stage and is calculated to show
    			the great chandelier to best advantage. The
    			audience is slowly being seated.
    
    
    9.			AN INTIMATE SHOT IN THE PORTIERRE
    
    			As people are being seated and chat with one another.
    
    
    10.			INTIMATE SHOT OF THE BOXES ON ONE SIDE.
    
    			General atmosphere scenes to show the nobility
    			and the gorgeous gowns worn by the women.
    
    
    11.			INT. ON BACK STAGE. . AMBER
    			This is a general shot of the backstage before
    			the rise of the curtain and must be most interesting
    			and picturesque. THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE IS ONE
    			OF CHAOS and confusion. Sixty stage hands are 
    			moving about the large pieces of scenery. They are
    			putting up the set for the first scene, the
    			home of Faust the aged alchemist. In evidence
    			are carpenters, florists, drapers, curtain hangers,
    			firemen, call-boys and property men. In the rear
    			of the stage is the dressing room corridor
    			leading to the numerous dressing rooms.
    
    
    TITLE				M. DEBIENNE AND M. POLIGNY, MANAGERS
    				OF THE OPERA HOUSE.
    
    
    12.			INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE.
    			FULL SHOT
    
    			Discovered M. Debienne, M. Poligny and M. Lavelle,
    			Secretary. The corpulent M. Debienne and the
    			slender M. Poligny appear to be in the throes of
    			a great mental stress - Debienne mops his perspiring
    			forehead and exhales deep sighs of despair while
    			Poligny stares into space with a gloomy expression --
    			at his desk nearby sits M. Lavelle, their secretary,
    			a bright dapper fellow, whose whistling at such
    			a trying moment grates on the managers' nerves--
    			every now and then he glances with contempt and
    			annoyment at the others' discomfiture--Debienne
    			glances despairingly at a large volume which lies
    			before them on the table open.
    
    
    INSERT OF VOLUME:
    			IT WILL BE BEST FOR YOU TO PERSUADE MME. CARLOTTA
    			NOT TO SING THE ROLE OF MARGUERITE ON PRESIDENT'S
    			NIGHT AND GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHRISTINE DAAE
    			HER UNDERSTUDY.
    					(Signed) THE GHOST
    
    
    			BACK:
    			Debienne's face shows his terror - he looks ap-
    			pealingly toward Poligny, who shrugs his shoulders
    			hopelessly. Lavelle laughs heartily, then says
    			with contempt:
    
    
    TITLE				"WHAT COULD BE MORE RIDICULOUS THAN 
    				ANYONE BELIEVING IN GHOSTS?"
    
    
    			BACK:
    			Debienne and Poligny sit up with frightened and
    			amazed starts - then look toward Lavelle who
    			laughs in scorn --suddenly all three start and look 
    			toward the door.
    
    
    13.			CLOSE UP of outside of heavy carved door.
    
    			A thin, bony and wrinkled hand is knocking.
    
    
    14.			INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE.
    
    			Debienne cowers in alarm and Poligny clutches the
    			arms of his chair for support - then Lavelle arises
    			with a contemptuous snort and strides to the door.
    
    
    15.			SEMI C.V. INSIDE HEAVY CARVED DOOR.
    
    			As Lavelle enters scene and then opens the door
    			with a look of contempt -- the corridor is empty.
    			Lavelle looks out, up and down -- then he recoils
    			and the contempt turns to terror - he closes the door
    			and bolts it - then stands there listening and
    			paralyzed with terror.
    
    
    16.			INT. CARLOTTA'S DRESSING ROOM.
    
    			We see the voluptuous Carlotta being dressed for
    			the part of "Marguerite" by her maid.
    
    
    TITLE				MME. CARLOTTA, PRIMA DONNA OF THE PARIS
    				OPERA COMPANY.
    
    
    16-A.			SEMI C.V. OF CARLOTTA (before mirror.)
    
    			This is the character study of a vain, temperamental
    			creature, who surveys herself in the mirror --
    			suddenly she starts and stares into the mirror --in
    			the mirror's reflection can be seen the door to the
    			corridor and underneath the door an envelope is
    			being slipped --she calls her maid and directs her 
    			to get the letter.
    
    
    17			INT CARLOTTA'S DRESSING ROOM.
    
    			As the maid gets the letter from under the door
    			and delivers it to Carlotta.
    
    
    17-A.			SEMI C.V. OF CARLOTTA (Before mirror)
    
    			As she opens the letter with a vain smile, thinking 
    			it from some admirer-- then as she reads, she gasps:
    
    
    INSERT OF LETTER:		"If you sing tonight, you will be
    				doing so in a house with a curse on it."
    							(signed) THE GHOST
    
    
    			BACK: 
    			Carlotta looks up from the letter in amazement--the
    			bitter rage fills her--she is furious and she tears
    			the letter in pieces and hurls them over her shoulder
    			in contempt as she talks to herself.
    
    
    18.			INT CHRISTINE DAAE'S DRESSING ROOM.
     
    			Discovered Christine also dressing for the part 
    			of Marguerite, but all alone --she appears sad and 
    			wistful.
     
    				CHRISTINE DAAE, A WISTFUL LITTLE 
    				CREATURE WITH A MARVELOUS VOICE.
    				AND THE UNDERSTUDY TO THE DYNAMIC 
    				CARLOTTA, WHOSE PERFECT HEALTH 
    				HAS KEPT CHRISTINE WAITING IN 
    				VAIN FOR THE BIG OPPORTUNITY.
    
     
     			SEMI C.V. OF CHRISTINE.
    
    			This is a character study of a wistful, sad-eyed 
    			creature, who dresses listlessly because she 
    			has about given up hope--a couple of tears roll 
    			down her cheeks, though she strives bravely to 
    			keep them back --then she dashes them away with her 
    			sleeve, angry at her weakness--all of a sudden she 
    			starts and listens.
     
    
     			INT. BEHIND MIRROR IN CORRIDOR...FAINT GREEN
     
    			Upon the wall is a shadow. It is shooting over a
    			man's shoulder against which is a violin which is
    			being played.
    
     
     
    			MED SHOT IN CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM 
     
    			As she slowly arises and crossing to the mirror
    			kneels before it in an attitude of prayer.
     
     
    			SEMI C.V. BEFORE MIRROR
     
    			As Christine finishes her silent prayer, crosses
    			herself then raises her face which now registers
    			exaltation--she begins to sing and act the part of
     			Marguerite before the mirror.
     
     
    				YEARS BEFORE, CHRISTINE'S FATHER 
    				PROMISED HER THAT WHEN HE DIED, HE 
    				WOULD SEND THE "ANGEL OF MUSIC" FROM 
    				HEAVEN TO TRAIN HER VOICE--AND HER 
    				SIMPLE SOUL BELIEVED THAT HE HAD.
     
    
    			BACK:
    			Christine continues to sing with increasing exaltation.
     
    
    			INT. IN CORRIDOR BACK OF MIRROR. .FAINT GREEN. 
    
    			The shadow of the violin is still playing.
     
     
    			INT. CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM. . AMBER
    
    			Christine is singing exultantly before the mirror. 
    			She comes to the end of her song and listens in 
    			the direction of the mirror with a faraway look in 
    			her eyes, then holding out her hands toward the 
    			mirror, she says pleading:
     
    
    				"OH ANGEL OF MUSIC! I'VE STUDIED
    				SO HARD. WILL I EVER GET THE CHANCE
    				TO SING THE ROLE OF MARGUERITE?"
     
     
    			INT. BEHIND MIRROR IN CORRIDOR. . FAINT GREEN
     
     			The shadowy violin strikes the last note. The 
    			shadowy violinist now assumes a profile position 
    			and reveals an outline of a head, face, neck and 
    			shoulders in shadow--it speaks: Then a mysterious
    			voice, as if from Heaven, sounded in her ears:
     
     
     				"MY CHILD, DO NOT LOSE HOPE--
    				YOUR GREAT DESIRE IS SOON TO BE 
    				REALIZED." 
    
    
     			SEMI C.V. OF CHRISTINE BEFORE MIRROR. 
    
     			She is overcome with great happiness--her eyes 
     			dance--her bosom heaves--she clasps and unclasps
     			her hands with joy.
    
     
     				NOT FAR FROM THE PARIS OPERA 
     				HOUSE -- THE CAFE EPINARD.
     
    
     			EXT. PARIS BOULEVARD. - NIGHT
     			FADE IN:
     
     			This is a picture of what people imagine the fashion-
     			able night life of Paris to be. The scene is an 
     			open boulevard cafe. These tables are sheltered by
     			ornate awnings. The period of 1890. The cafe and 
     			street are electric lighted. 
     			It is a scene of laughter and gaiety. The women 
     			are dressed in the evening dress of the period. 
     			The large windows facing the sidewalk are open and 
     			all is lightness and merriment inside. The sidewalk 
     			tables are filled. Fashionably dressed people are 
     			promenading up and down the sidewalk. Carriages are 
     			drawing up and departing, parties are bidding 
     			each other goodbye.
     
    
     			SEMI C.V. AT ONE OF THE TABLES.
     
     			Discovered Capt. Raoul de Chagny, wearing a dress 
     			uniform of the French army.  He has a beautiful 
     			girl beside him and across from them are seated the 
     			Vicomte Philippe, Raoul's brother and the Comtess,
     			his wife.  It is easy to see that Raoul is the life
     			of the party and that his brother is proud of him--
     			also that the girl beside him is smitten on him.
    
    
     				CAPTAIN RAOUL DE CHAGNY, OF THE OLD
     				ARISTOCRATIC HOUSE OF CHAGNY, ENVIED
     				BY ALL THE YOUTH OF PARIS, BECAUSE OF
     				HIS WAY WITH WOMEN.
                                    
     
     			C.V. OF RAOUL  
     
     			This is a character study of a light hearted, witty 
     			young Lothario, who apparently doesn't take anything 
     			seriously - not even life.
     
    
     			SEMI C.V. RAOUL - and his companion, the beautiful
     			girl.
     
     			He leans toward her and there is a look of deviltry
     			in his dancing eyes, as he whispers:
    
     
     				"YOU'RE INTOXICATING, MARIE. .I LIKE
     				TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU SOMETIME. . IN
     				THE MOONLIGHT!"
     
    
     			BACK:
     			The girl is all thrilled and quivers with delight 
     			at his flattery--his hand moves down under the
     			table.
     
     
     			CLOSE UP UNDER TABLE.
     
     			As Raoul's hand searches and finds Marie's hand 
     			giving it a squeeze - the way she starts indicates
     			how she is thrilled.
     
     
     			SEMI C.V. PHILIPPE AND THE COMTESS
    
     			They are watching, with looks of satisfaction.
    
     
     				RAOUL'S BROTHER, THE VISCOUNT
     				PHILIPPE AND HIS WIFE THE
     				COMTESS.
     
     
     			BACK:
     			The Comtess whispers behind her fan to her husband:
    
     
     				"MARIE AND RAOUL SHOULD MAKE A 
     				GREAT MATCH. I'M THANKFUL YOU 
     				BROKE UP THAT SILLY INFATUATION
     				HE HAD FOR THAT CHRISTINE DAAE 
     				PERSON."
     
    
     			BACK:     
     			Philippe nods and a worried sort of expression
     			comes over his face--He replies:
     
    
     				"HE HASN'T FORGOTTEN HER. I
     				FIND HE'S BEEN HUNTING ALL 
     				OVER PARIS FOR HER."
     
    
     			BACK:
     			The Comtess shows displeasure and contempt.
     
    
     			SEMI C.V. OF TABLE
     
     			Raoul is still playing up to Marie and she is simply 
     			wild about him--then Philippe produces his watch 
     			and says with a start:
     
    
     				"WE'LL BE LATE FOR THE OPERA    
     				IF WE DON'T HURRY!"
     
    
     			BACK:
     			This brings Raoul and Marie back to earth - he 
     			springs up to help Marie into her wrap and Philippe 
     			does likewise for his wife- then the party moves 
     			out toward the boulevard.
     
    
     			MED. SHOT OF BOULEVARD AT CAFE CURB.
     
     			As a footman calls for a carriage - Raoul and party 
     			as they get in and are driven off.
    
    
     			BACK STAGE.
     			LONG SHOT
    
     			Showing that the set for the first act is almost
     			ready.
     
    
     			SEMI C.V. ON STAGE  --near dressing room corridor.
     
     			A burly type is directing the movement of scenery
     			and close beside him stands another type who is 
     			stitching some canvas rip in a wing -- behind them
     			is another type, a clownish fellow pretending to be
     			sweeping, but with his eyes on the ballet girls in 
     			corridor entrance, who taunt him by kicking up their 
     			legs at him.
     
    
     				SIMON BUQUET, HEAD SCENE SHIFTER 
     
     
     			CLOSE UP OF SIMON BUQUET.
     
     			This is a character study of a radical type who 
     			issues orders in a sharp, domineering manner.
     
    
     				SIMON'S BROTHER, JOSEPH.
     
    
     			CLOSE UP OF JOSEPH
     
     			This is a character study of an opposite type to
     			Simon--a slow, lymphatic temperament - the type to
     			be pitied- he finishes mending the torn canvas 
     			and straightens up, wincing at his cramped back
     			and making agonized faces.
     
     
     			SEMI C.V. JOSEPH BUQUET.
     
     			As Simon enters scene and affectionately rubs his 
     			back for him - Buquet accepts his brother's aid 
     			in a manner that shows he is accustomed to being 
     			petted by Simon and he likes it. Simon puts his 
     			arm about his brother's shoulder and says:
    
     
     				"A COLD GLASS OF BEER WOULD DO WONDERS 
    				FOR YOUR ACHING BACK, TAKE A SNEAK."
    
     
     			BACK: 
     			Joseph rewards Simon with a grateful smile - smacks
     			his lips and ambles off with Simon watching after 
     			him, with brotherly interest and affection. When 
     			Simon turns casually and looks toward dressing room 
     			corridor, he starts in annoyance, as he sees:
     
     
     			INTIMATE SHOT OF FLORINE AND SOME BALLET GIRLS. AMBER.
     
     			Florine, through his long association with the Opera
     			has never lost his appreciation of beautiful limbs. 
     			He cannot keep his mind on his business. The girls,
     			of course, all know Florine. The girls tickle and
     			otherwise make sport with Florine. He has a smile
     			for each of them. One of them makes a broad sweep
     			with her legs and just touches him in the back of 
     			the cap - tilting the visor of the cap over his eyes.
     
    
     				EVERY STAGE CREW HAS ITS CLOWN 
    				AND THE PARIS OPERA HAD FLORINE PAPILION.
     
    
     			C.V. OF FLORINE
     
     			As he raises the visor of his cap and makes silly 
     			faces at the girls, using his broom as a sword at 
     			his side.
     
    
     			C.V. OF SIMON
     
     			He frowns savagely and strides toward Florine who 
     			is off scene.
     
    
     			INTIMATE SHOT OF FLORINE AND SOME BALLET GIRLS
     
     			Florine is clowning and does not see Simon who 
     			enters scene behind him --then as Florine stoops in 
     			a low bow, Simon kicks him in the pants. Florine 
     			becomes rigid, but does not look around. He knows 
     			that this is not a woman's kick. Without looking
     			around he steps upon a scene elevator and disappears 
     			below with a piece of scenery.
     
    
    39. 			INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE.
     
     			The corpulent Debienne is seated in chair in a 
     			state bordering on collapse - his partner the slim 
     			Poligny, paces the floor in agony--both start as 
     			the door opens and their secretary M. Lavelle enters, 
     			wringing his hands and all upset. His face is 
     			severely scratched, showing where finger nails have
     			left their marks as they clawed down his face --the
     			managers gasp at the sight of his face. He chokes 
     			as he says:
    
    
     				"CARLOTTA'S IN A TERRIBLE TEMPER!
    				SHE SAYS THAT CHRISTINE DAAE WILL
    				SING HER ROLE TONIGHT,--OVER HER
    				DEAD BODY!"
    
    
     			BACK:
     			Debienne gasps in agony and sinks back in his chair--
     			Poligny almost collapses and Lavelle grabs his 
     			wounded face with his kerchief.
      
    
    40. 			INT. CARLOTTA'S DRESSING ROOM
     
     			A maid is completing her for the part of 
     			Marguerite -- she is boiling over with rage which 
     			makes it difficult for the maid to dress her. She 
     			talks excitedly to her personal manager, a type, 
     			saying:
    
     
    				"A GHOST DOESN'T WANT ME TO SING! 
    				IMAGINE ANY THING SO RIDICULOUS!"
     
    
     			BACK: 
     			Carlotta bursts into scornful laughter - she'll 
     			show them --they won't put anything over on her
     			so clumsy as all that.
    
     
    41. 			INT. AUDITORIUM - from rear toward stage. 
    
     			This shows the house nearly filled and the orchestra 
     			starts the overture.
     
    
    42. 			CLOSE UP IN ONE BOX.
     
     			Two young ladies and their parents are seated in 
     			the box- the one girl is looking the house over 
     			with her opera glasses, suddenly she turns them 
     			toward the opposite tier of boxes and a happy smile 
     			appears on her face as she sees:
     
    
    43.			CLOSE UP IN PHILIPPE'S BOX.
     
     			Philippe, the Comtess, Raoul and Marie are just
     			being seated. Raoul always extending himself to
     			be attentive to Marie.
    
    
    44.			CLOSE UP IN BOX AS IN SCENE 42.
     
     			The girl lowers the opera glasses and her heart 
     			beats fast - her eyes dance-- she nudges her 
     			girl companion and says:
     
    
    
     				"OVER THERE IS THAT HANDSOME CAPT.
    				RAOUL DE CHAGNY. LUCKY GIRL TO BE
    				WITH HIM."
     
    
     			BACK:
     			The girl finishes speech and lends the glasses to 
     			her eager and interested companion who looks as 
     			directed by the other.
     
    
    45. 			AN INTIMATE SHOT (CLOSE UP) RAOUL AND MARIE.
     
     			He is bending close to her, a mischievous smile 
     			on his face and whispering sweet words of flattery 
     			into her ears -- she is all thrills and emotion.
     
    
    46. 			CLOSE UP IN BOX AS IN SCENE 44.
     
     			The second girl still looks thru the glasses - her 
     			bosom rising and falling with emotion, her expression 
     			one of envy - the first girl thinks she has had a 
     			long enough look, as she takes another look herself. 
     			The other sighs deeply and says enviously:
    
     
     				"WHAT COULD BE MORE HEAVENLY 
    				THAN TO BE LOVED BY A MAN
    				LIKE HIM?" 
    
    
     			BACK:
     			Without removing the glasses from her eyes, the
     			first girl also sighs and nods in the affirmative.

     			At the end of this corridor is a door to the 
     			stage and in the foreground is the entrance to 
     			Box #5, so designated plainly above the door.
     			The door from the stage opens and Meg Giry, an old 
     			hag enters, carrying a footstool and a vase of
     			flowers--she talks to herself and walks with an 
     			unfirm tread to the door to box 5, where she enters.
     
    
     			INTERIOR ANTE ROOM TO BOX 5.

     			INTERIOR BOX 5.
     
     			As Meg Giry enters, there is a motherly attitude
     			about her as she carefully arranges the flowers in 
     			the vase on a small stand--places the footstool
     			before one of the chairs and places the program 
     			on the same chair.

     			BACK:
     			Mother Giry surveys her work critically, then 
     			changes the position of the chair and footstool a
     			trifle-- picks up a few bits of lint, then exits
     			with a satisfied smile.
     
     
     			MED. SHOT IN DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR.
     
     			In f.g. are a number dandies of the time with 
     			flowers and candies, quarreling for first place 
     			outside of a dressing room door - then one knocks 
     			and a maid opens the door from within revealing 
     			the dressing room of La Sorelli, leader of the

     			INT. DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR.
     
     			Another section of same corridor as in 13. Here we see a 
     			general commotion of ballet girls, some in pink 
     			tights and others partly dressed running in and 
     			out of dressing rooms buying and drinking cassaie 
     			and beer from a vendor. Some are singing - some
     			dancing and some quarreling.
     
    
     			AN INTIMATE SHOT OF GROUP OF BALLET GIRLS. 
    
     			They are having a serious confab - one of the 
     			girls eyes are dilated to a great size as she 
     			tells the others
     
    
     				"MOTHER GIRY SAYS SOMETHING 
    				TERRIBLE IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO- 
    				NIGHT -- CAUSE THE GHOST ORDERED

    				CARLOTTA."
     
    
     			BACK:
     			The other ballet girls laugh in derision and dis-
     			belief. Then one bold girl says with a laugh:
     
    
     				"YOU TALK LIKE THAT CRAZY SCENE 
    				SHIFTER, JOSEPH BUQUET. LET'S 
    				GO DOWN IN THE CELLARS AND

     			BACK: 
     			The other girls excepting the one who spoke first 
     			agree it will be a great lark - they try to 
     			pull the frightened one along, but she fights loose
     			and runs away.
     
     
     			MED. SHOT OF DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR (toward stage.)
     
     			As frightened ballet girl runs toward rear while 
     			the bold group led by the one who made the dare 
     			leads the way forward -- all are laughing in 
     			scorn of such a thing as a Ghost. They reach 
     			head of cellar steps and pause. Each wants the 
     			other to go first - they tug at each other and 
     			one girl is pushed ahead. Then the others follow 
     			down the steps.

     			Florine enters from beyond the arched doorway in 
     			the rear. He starts up the step toward the 
     			dressing room corridor. The six ballet girls, 
     			holding each other by the arms and huddled together, 
     			enter to the landing in the stairs. They pretend 
     			great fright. They cluster around Florine and 
     			bowl him down the stairs again. They are not going 
     			to be left alone.
     
    
     			A LONGER SHOT. . FAINT GREEN
    
     			The ballet girls run in to the landing upon the

     			MED. CLOSE UP AT FOOT OF STAIRS. . FAINT GREEN
     
     			The girls want him to lead them to Joseph Buquet.
     			He is proud of their confidence and he beams. 
     			The girls surround him and each takes hold of his 
     			arm or his belt and the group moves through the 
     			arch and exits to the right.
     
    
     			INT. CELLAR SHOT. .#4. . FAINT GREEN
    
     			This is the set in which there is a headless statue.
     			In this scene, however, the light is not on the 
     			headless statue and it can hardly be seen. Joseph 
     			Buquet is at work under a shaded gas jet, sewing up 
     			the cheek of John the Baptist. Florine and the ballet 
     			girls enter. The girls huddle around Buquet as 
     			if they found protection in his presence. They begin 
     			to question the glassy eyed man, he looks around 
     			apprehensively as if all the shadows might be 
     			inhabited. As Buquet talks he switches the head
     			around, sometimes holding it by the hair. This 
     			head has practical eyes that open and close. Buquet
     			tells them:
    
    
     				"HIS EYES ARE SO DEEP THAT YOU 
    				CAN HARDLY SEE THE PUPILS. .
    				JUST TWO BLACK HOLES IN A DEAD 
    				MAN'S SKULL."
     
    
     			BACK:
     			The girls show horror and fascination. A pained
     			expression comes over Florine's face. Buquet con-
     			tinues:
     
    
    				"HIS SKIN IS A NASTY YELLOW AND
    				STRETCHED ACROSS HIS BONES LIKE 
    				A DRUMHEAD. HIS NOSE. . THERE 
    				IS NO NOSE!"
     
    
     			BACK:
     			The girls are held spell bound. Florine shivers 
     			and tells Buquet with apprehensiveness:
     
     
    				"YOU KNOW THE GHOST DOESN'T 
    				LIKE BEING TALKED ABOUT."
     
    
     			BACK:
     			Buquet looks into Florine's face with his big 
     			hollow eyes as if he had not heard him. Then he 
     			tells the girls:
     
     
     				"I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE I SAW HIM . . 
    				BETWEEN THE SCENE OF A FARM HOUSE 
    				AND THE "KING OF LAHORE" SET."
     
     
     			BACK:
     			This is too much for Florine. He decides not to go 
     			with them and begins to walk away, but the girls 
     			grab him. They are not going to be left alone 
     			with Buquet after what he has said. Buquet leads 
     			them down a flight of stairs; after he has care-
     			fully laid the head aside. Florine keeps his eye 
     			on the head until he is out.
     
     
     			CELLAR SET #5. . FAINT GREEN 
    
     			This is the "King of Lahore" set. On the left is 
     			a suggestion of a farm house scene, the elaborate 
     			piece of "King of Lahore" scenery, then a circular 
     			staircase, and on the right, a scene rack which is 
     			moved by a hand switch. In front of the "King of 
     			Lahore" scenery is a concealed trap in the floor 
     			and back of the set is a dark opening.
     
     			Joseph Buquet leads the girls and Florine down the 
     			circular staircase to a position before the "Lahore" 
     			set.
     
    
    			INT. CLOSE UP OF GROUP. .FAINT GREEN.
     
    			Buquet points his skinny finger at the dark 
    			column of the "Lahore" set and begins to explain 
    			that it was in that shadow that he saw the Ghost. 
    			The girls are looking into the shadow, fascinated, 
    			as if the Ghost might appear there again. But 
    			Florine is looking at the dark opening in the wall 
    			behind the set. His eyes are fixed upon something 
    			and he stands stiff and paralyzed.
     
     
    			CLOSE UP FLORINE. .FAINT GREEN 
    
    			He stares with a fixed expression of frozen horror.
     
     
    			CLOSE UP THE DARK OPENING IN WALL. . FAINT GREEN 
    
    			There is a motion in the dark opening - something 
    			undefined, but plainly a motion of a dark shadow 
    			shape - the gas light goes down and then up.
     
     
    			CLOSE UP FLORINE. . FAINT GREEN
     
    			Florine gives one terrific scream, as if his heart 
    			would break with terror.
     
    
    			A LONGER SHOT. . FAINT GREEN
     
    			The girls almost die of fright, genuine fright this 
    			time. There is a frightened clamor on the part of 
    			the girls and Florine to be the first to reach the 
    			circular staircase. Buquet stands quietly looking 
    			at them with his hollow, glassy eyes. The girls 
    			reach the stairs and run up the circular stairs 
    			laughing at each other and screaming. Florine 
    			tears up the staircase to the first landing when 
    			his momentum carries him out of the opening and 
    			upon the floor at his starting point. He tears 
    			up the stairs again.
     
    
    			CELLAR #4. . FAINT GREEN.
     
    			This set is now seen in another lighting so that 
    			the big headless statue with outstretched arms 
    			stands in bold relief. The girls fleeing in 
    			terror, followed by Florine, run up the stairs into 
    			the picture and almost into the arms of the headless 
    			statue. They break away from the statue and 
    			run out the right. Florine takes a short cut, 
    			running out the right, back of the pile of prop-
    			erties.
    
    
    			CELLAR #3. . FAINT GREEN
     
    			This is the Sigfried dragon's head. The girls 
    			run in from the left, get their reaction of fright 
    			from the dragon and run off to the right. Florine 
    			runs in and stops to get his breath. He knows all 
    			about the ordinary props down here and is not 
    			afraid. Door in dragon's mouth opens and in- 
    			definite shadowy figure is seen in back. He gives 
    			one sickly look of terror and runs out to the right.
     
    
    			CELLAR #2. . FAINT GREEN.
    
    			This is the dummy set. The girls run in and shrink 
    			from the dummies which are hanging in insane 
    			postures, one up-side down, another with a broken 
    			back. One of the girls gets tangled up in the 
    			ropes which hold the dummies and they begin to 
    			jerk up and down and their arms flap. The other 
    			girl rescues the one in the ropes and they run out.
     
    
    			CELLAR BRIDGE SET. . FAINT GREEN
    
    			At the right of this set is a trap-door elevator. 
    			Florine runs in, jumps on the elevator and pulls a 
    			lever. This makes the elevator shoot upward.
     
    
    			EXT. ON BACK STAGE. .AMBER
     
    			This shot is back of the scene. Simon is peeping 
    			through the scenery and talking to a stage hand. 
    			A couple of feet from him a trap falls open and 
    			Florine shoots up into the air about four feet, 
    			lights on his feet, nonchalantly tries to appear 
    			that he is doing his regular work, picks up a 
    			prop and walks off. Simon looks after him with 
    			suspicious exasperation.

    			This is a conventional dressing room, such as
    			would be furnished to a star, or to La Sorelli, who 
    			is the head of the ballet. She is also the 
    			friend of the younger dancers. The scene is one 
    			of languor, a little of what people expect of Parisian 
    			naughtiness. A beautifully formed, languorous 
    			creature is reclining upon a couch and is being 
    			entertained by two or three smartly dressed young 
    			Parisians.  La Sorelli is before the mirror with 
    			an admirer and her maid. The admirer playfully 
    			takes the place of the maid and is allowed to 
    			fasten the top button in the back of her dress. 
    			Their playful pastimes are interrupted by a violent 
    			knocking at the door.

    			together:
    
    
    				"WE SAW THE GHOST!
    				THE OPERA GHOST!"
    
     
    			BACK:
    			La Sorelli is superstitious concerning the ghost  
    			and she shudders. She of all in the room takes it
    			seriously. The dandies laugh at the idea, as if
    			it were some new trick the girls were playing.
    			The girls all continue talking at once to La Sorelli

    			SHOOTING FROM THE STAGE. .AMBER.
     
    			This shot shows the vast audience from this angle,
    			settled in their seats for the performance, but in 
    			the f.g. is the prompter's box. The prompter is 
    			arranging his papers. He is a dapper, grouchy little 
    			fellow. He bends down until he is almost out of 
    			sight, the opening from the stage to the prompter's 
    			box must be large enough to admit a person through it.
    
    
    			LONG SHOT FROM REAR OF AUDITORIUM TOWARD STAGE.
    
    			The curtain rises on the home of Faust the aged

    			Florine is peeping through one of the stage en-

    			INT. LIGHT CONTROL ROOM. .AMBER
     
    			We have an illustration of the light control room 
    			and machinery. This room is under the stage and 
    			in it is a short flight of steps leading to the 
    			platform upon which the prompter is standing. The 
    			light control man is standing near his levers but 
    			has evidently neglected to watch the time. The 
    			prompter, who can be seen bending down from his  
    			box, calls the man's attention to the time. The 
    			control man looks at his watch which is hanging in 
    			front of him and immediately begins to pull two 
    			levers, each in an opposite direction. Aside from 
    			the interesting nature of this shot it seems to 
    			plant the scenery for future situation.

    			As Philippe comes down the stairs into f.g. 
    			with the Comtess and Marie on his arm - Marie 
    			keeps looking about anxiously - then she turns 
    			to Philippe with a look of disappointment and
    			says:
     
    
    				"WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE RAOUL WENT!"
     
    
    			BACK:
    			Philippe frowns darkly and he replies:

    				LOOKING UP SOME OF HIS COMMON AC-
    				QUAINTANCES."
    
    
    			BACK:

    91.			MED. SHOT ON SECOND LANDING OF GRAND STAIRCASE.
     
    			The eyes of all the promenaders suddenly focus 
    			on the Persian who comes down a flight of stairs 
    			to the landing where he stops and looks about 
    			casually.
     
     
    				A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER WAS THE PERSIAN 
    				A REGULAR PATRON OF THE OPERA AND 
    				ALWAYS ALONE, WHOSE SOURCE OF INCOME 
    				WAS AS MUCH OF AN ENIGMA AS THE MAN 
    				HIMSELF.
    
    
    			C.V. OF THE PERSIAN.
     
    			This is a character study of a strange type - 
    			he wears a dress suit and carries an astrachan cap. 
    			He has olive skin, appears greatly interested in 
    			his surroundings but never smiles.
     
    
    			MED. SHOT ON SECOND LANDING - AS IN 91.
     
    			The Persian moves down the steps off scene and

    			INT. CORNER FOYER DE DANCE. . AMBER.
     
    			This is located in the rear of the stage. 
    			The richness of this room is executed principally 
    			upon glass. It is a place of reunion between the 
    			ballet girls and their admirers. In special prom-
    			inence are the dancers' practicing bars. They hold 
    			to those bars while standing upon their toes or 
    			place one ankle upon the bar while they stand upon 
    			one toe and while they are doing these things 
    			they are talking to their admirers. This is a gen-
    			eral entrance scene of the ballet girls and thirty 
    			or more young and old Parisian dandies, patrons of 
    			the opera, who are allowed in the foyer de dance 
    			during the intermissions. It is a picture of pink 
    			tights, fluffy lace skirts and Parisian dandies. 
    			There is a flirting air of lightness, merriment 
    			and laughter about. Some are practicing their 
    			steps, others are flirting. Capt. Raoul is notice-
    			able, carrying on a familiar conversation with 
    			La Sorelli, the ballet queen.
    
    
    			SEMI C.V. LA SORELLI AND RAOUL
     
    			Raoul is kidding her along and it is noticeable 
    			that she is fascinated by his personality. Several 
    			of the dandies we saw previously in her dressing 
    			room come up and seek to draw her attention but 
    			she pays them no heed and they are greatly ex-
    			asperated.
     
     
    			BACK STAGE. . FULL SET.
     
    			As workmen finish setting scene for the ballet -

    			As she looks on with that same wistful expression.
     
     
    			SEMI C.V. OF SORELLI AND RAOUL.
     
    			Raoul suddenly looks at his watch - is startled -
    			indicates he must get back to his box - he leans 
    			close and whispers something in her ear with a 
    			devilish smile on his face. Her eyes light up with 
    			delight - she nods her head in the affirmative -
    			he exits laughing, she waving after him.
     
     
    			BACK STAGE. (AT SIDE)
     
    			As Raoul enters still laughing to himself, he 
    			chances to look at a big mirror and stops aghast 
    			as he sees:
     
     
    			C.V. RAOUL BY BIG MIRROR.
     
    			In the mirror's reflection can be seen Christine 
    			Daae standing in entrance to dressing room corridor -
    			Raoul gasps and whirls around.
     
     
    			C.V. CHRISTINE
     
    			As she suddenly sees Raoul off scene and her eyes 
    			dilate in amazement.
     
     
    			C.V. OF RAOUL.
     
    			He staring in surprise - then starts forward with

    			As Raoul starts toward Christine, she turns and

    			INT. DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR.
     
    			As few last of ballet hurry past camera - then 
    			Raoul hurries in from behind camera and looks
    			madly about - he runs to the cross corridor where
    			he looks up and down.
    
     
    			C.V. OF RAOUL
     
    			His face falls in disappointment - his shoulders 
    			droop - then a look of determination comes into 
    			his eyes. He smiles as he has an idea - he exits.
     
    
    			A LONG SHOT FROM REAR OF AUDITORIUM.
     
    			The curtain rises and the "Faust" ballet begins. 
    			From data that we have in the office 150 ballet

    			INT. BOX CORRIDOR.
     
    			As Raoul opens door and enters from the stage - 
    			he wears a grim look and he enters the box.
     
    
    			INT. PHILIPPE'S BOX.
     
    			As Raoul returns - Philippe and the Comtess glower 
    			at him and Marie playfully scolds him - Raoul is 
    			too filled with emotion to pay her any attention. 
    			She is amazed at his sudden indifference.
     
    
    			INT. AUDITORIUM. . AMBER. 
    
    			This is the Long Shot. It is a short scene of the
    			falling of the curtain upon the grand ballet. The

    			relaxation runs over the audience.
     
    
    			CLOSE UP IN PHILIPPE'S BOX.
     
    			Raoul will not look at Marie - he keeps looking 
    			at Philippe becoming more angry every minute - then 
    			arising he moves to the door to ante-room and 
    			motions for Philippe to follow. Philippe does so 
    			in wonder at Raoul's strange behavior.
     
     
    			ANTE ROOM OF PHILIPPE'S BOX
     
    			As Raoul and Philippe come out of box and into f.g. -

    				HER -- BACK ON THE STAGE!"
     
    
    			BACK:
    			Philippe gasps in surprise first - then he too 
    			becomes angry and he answers:
     
    
    				"I THOUGHT YOU'D COME TO YOUR 
    				SENSES, BUT I SEE YOU'RE DETER-

    			BACK:
    			Raoul's eyes light up with a dangerous light -

    			back into the box. Raoul hesitates for a second,
    			to cool down, then follows.

    130.			INT. CELLAR #5.  (RIO DE LAHORE)   FAINT GREEN.
     
    			Florine is discovered at the hand winch on the 
    			right. The turning of this winch lifts and lowers 
    			the scene frames on the right. Florine is turning 
    			this winch. He is frightened stiff, frightened at 
    			the black opening in the wall where sometime before
    			he saw a movement. As he turns winch his
    			frightened eyes, therefore, are upon the black 
    			opening.

    			As Florine turns the winch two scene frames move
    			upward and one downward. The movement of these 
    			discovers the shadow upon the center wall of
    			a man, hanging, gently swinging. As the frames
    			move both ways, all or any part of the hanging man may 
    			be shown. Florine does not see either the hanging 
    			man or the shadow at first, so intent is he upon 
    			the black opening. He now turns and through the 
    			framework in front of him he is confronted by the
    			hanging man. The audience cannot see this, only
    			the shadow. Florine is paralyzed with fear and his
    			knees knock together. He backs away from the ap-
    			parition and turns to escape up the stairs. But he 
    			is now confronted with the shadow. He is in utmost 
    			distress. He is surrounded with hanging men. After an 
    			instant of confusion, Florine runs the gauntlet

    			sitting upon the floor gossiping. Simon enters from 
    			the right, looking for somebody when Florine runs
    			in from the cellar below. Any attempt at comedy is
    			avoided. Florine becomes a whimpering, pathetic

    			a ring bolt in the stone wall by a strap and is 
    			parallel with the wall. The blacksmith is holding 
    			up the hoof of the great white stallion to measure 
    			a shoe, then he moves over to the forge and with 
    			his back to the horse pumps the bellows and sings 
    			to himself -- then a strange thing happens, a section 
    			of the wall and floor upon which the white stallion 
    			stands suddenly turns as if upon an axle and the white 
    			stallion vanishes leaving apparently the same
    			wall floor and ring bolt - the smithy lifts the red
    			hot shoe from the forge and prepares to hammer it.
    			He casually looks around toward the place where the
    			horse was, gasps and drops the hammer. Then thinking
    			perhaps one of the stablemen played a joke, he calls

    			Florine looks for the shadow - then he looks for 
    			the body. Both are gone. His mind seems to be 
    			helpless to grasp the situation. By one second all 
    			eyes center upon the object in the f.g., in a 
    			hushed, awed manner they move to the object. Simon

    			room and hurries toward camera.  Raoul ducks back 
    			and watches as Christine passes his place of hiding 
    			without seeing him. She passes corner and he 
    			watches after her. Then filled with a jealous rage, 
    			he darts out and dashes toward her dressing room.

    			INT CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM. AMBER
     
    			A gas light is burning near the closet door. Raoul 
    			rushes into the room.  It is empty. He supposes 
    			that the man is there. He looks under the couch 
    			and sees no one is there. He looks into the closet. 
    			He feels the walls as if they hold some secret. 
    			Then he pauses to think.
     
     
    			C.V. OF RAOUL.
     
    			He has paused in the midst of his blind rage 
    			to wonder. Is he losing his mind...has his ear 
    			deceived him? He suffers chagrin and sheathes 
    			his sword. Then the thought occurs to him that 
    			he will overtake Christine and demand an 
    			explanation.

    			As Raoul runs into the scene from Christine's 
    			dressing room, a solemn procession enters from 
    			the stairs leading to the first cellar.  Two men 
    			are carrying the body of Joseph Buquet upon a 
    			stretcher. Buquet's face is covered with a handker-
    			chief which has been dampened and will cling closely
    			to his face. There are five other stage hands and
    			the procession including Simon and Florine. 
    			Simon leans heavily on two companions-stage hands and 
    			sobs silently. All have their heads down. As 
    			procession comes from the cellar, moves toward the
    			stage, interrupts Raoul's hasty exit and delays
    			him. He slows up his pace and bows his head in
    			the presence of death.

    				RAOUL HAD FOUND CHRISTINE ONLY TO

    			On the stage door is a sign in French which reads,
    			"Closed for repairs" nearby waits a barouche and
    			in it sits Raoul. A gendarme passes casually, looks
    			at Raoul and moves on.

    			Raoul's eyes light up with a start of hope. He
    			hails Lavelle who is off scene and hurries to get
    			out of the barouche. 
     
     
    			SEMI C.V. BY WALL OF OPERA HOUSE.
     
    			Lavelle has halted and is waiting with a knowing
    			look and somewhat annoyed. Then Raoul enters
    			scene with a hopeful look. He produces a letter
    			and hands it to the other. Lavelle shakes his
    			head in the negative and refuses to take it.
    			Raoul pleads and the other still refuses. 
    			Then Raoul produces money. Lavelle weakens. 
    			Raoul chooses a large note and places it with 
    			the letter, forces it into Lavelle's hand, gives
    			him a smile and a pat and exits. Lavelle 
    			looks after him, still undecided, then he

    			entering and leaving cafe. Beggars and thieves
    			and characters. There is a group of about fourteen
    			working men upon the corner. Simon and Florine 
    			are in the center of group. The group is
    			listening to Simon who is haranguing them and the

    			The working men, interesting characters, are

    			The speaker is excited and emphatic. As he

    			Florine has become quite an important person. 
    			From a mere assistant scene shifter, he has become 
    			the man who first discovered the body. Florine 
    			is pantomiming his discovery of the body, miming 
    			some of the harrowing details. He goes thru this 
    			with an air of sweeping bravado. The others 
    			are listening in childlike wonder. They envy him.
     
    
    			MED. CLOSE UP SIMON'S GROUP. BLUE
     
    			Simon is trying to get over to the others the

    			of intense agony and pleading, she sobs:
     
    
    				"I LOVE HIM, GRANDMA.... I'M SURE OF

    			He recovers his poise, a bit, and shakes his head 
    			in the negative, Christine's face falls and she 
    			swallows hard. Lavelle takes the chance to get

     			up with Raoul's letter. As Christine sees it, her 
     			face is transfigured with joy. She seizes it

    			The location is a quaint little garden in Brittany. 
    			In the b.g. looking over a low garden wall is the 
    			ocean. Upon the left is a little Inn. The Inn of 
    			the Setting Sun. On the right there is a little 
    			arbor. Christine is discovered, occupied with 
    			thoughts of long ago. Christine's dress is so 
    			conceived that it will lend to the spiritual quality
    			of her character. She is sad and passive and looks
    			a frail little figure.
     
    
    			MED. CLOSE UP CHRISTINE.
     
    			Her spirituality and the mystery surrounding her are 
    			brought out.  She sees someone approaching and is 
    			enveloped in a complexity of emotions. She loves
    			Raoul and her eyes twinkle. She fears the meeting
    			and her heart aches, yet she yearns for it and she 
    			runs toward the wall.
     
    
    			A LONGER SHOT.
     
    			With glad anticipation - Christine runs to the
    			low wall. Raoul runs in and jumps over the wall

    			MED. CLOSE UP RAOUL AND CHRISTINE.
     
    			Eagerly he devours her with his eyes and is about to

    			that she is his for the taking. However, he is 
    			suddenly choked by an onrush of jealousy and his 
    			arms drop to his side. He speaks to her 
    			impetuously:
     
    
    				"WHY DIDN'T YOU WISH TO RECOGNIZE 
    				ME IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM?... WHY 
    				WERE YOU SO ANXIOUS FOR ME TO GO?"
     
     
    			BACK: The bright eagerness dies out of her eyes. 
    			She stands staring at Raoul without replying. 
    			She cannot answer because there is too much to 
    			explain. 'You don't answer' he indicates 
    			unhappily.  Then with an outburst of jealousy 
    			and suspicion, he exclaims:
     
    
    				"I'LL ANSWER FOR YOU! ..IT WAS 
    				BECAUSE THERE WAS ANOTHER WITH YOU... 
    				A MAN FROM WHOM YOU MUST HIDE OUR

    			At these words from Raoul, a deathly pallor spreads
    			over Christine's face...she almost faints. Raoul
    			becomes conscious of his odious behavior and seeks 
    			to apologize. Then suddenly her eyes moisten and   
    			two great tears roll down her cheeks. Raoul tries
    			to take her in his arms, but she escapes and flees 
    			in great disorder. Raoul calls after her, then 
    			angry at himself...turns and gazes, gloomily out
    			over the sea.
     
    
    			ANOTHER SECTION OF THE LITTLE GARDEN.
     
    			As Christine flees into scene from behind camera. 
    			Then she steps and turns around revealing that she 
    			is sorry she ran away. She makes up her mind

    			too serious for this. The tears trickle down her 
    			cheek as she begins to speak:
     
    
    				"YOU REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE WERE 
    				CHILDREN, MY FATHER TOLD US OF THE
    				ANGEL OF MUSIC...HOW WHEN HE VISITED 
    				PEOPLE, THOSE PEOPLE HAD GENIUS?"

    			more lightly than before.
     
     
    				"IT WAS HIS VOICE YOU HEARD. HE 
    				VISITS ME NIGHTLY IN MY DRESSING 
    				ROOM TO GIVE ME MUSIC LESSONS."
    
    
    			BACK:  Raoul bursts out laughing - a mad laugh -
    			and to Christine, a rude, insulting laugh.  She
    			draws away from him with a hostile air. He tells
    			her with intensity:
    
    
    				"CHRISTINE SOMEBODY IS MAKING A 
    				GAME OF YOU."

    			EXT IN GARDEN AT PERROS. BLUE SLOW FADE IN.
     
    			It is night of the same day. The play of light 
    			and shadow makes a beautiful but depressing scene. 
    			There is a stage background. At first, the heaven
    			is filled with stars. Then as the full moon
    			begins to rise over the horizon, the stars begin 
    			to fade and long shadows creep out into the garden.
    			Raoul is sitting in the little alcove just where 
    			he was left. He is downcast and gloomy. His
    			attention suddenly becomes centered. The door 
    			opens - The door to the Inn and he arises. Slowly
    			the door opens and Christine enters, dressed all in
    			white. Her eyes are fixed and look into space. She 
    			moves like one walking in her sleep. Raoul

    			caution.
     
     
    			EXT. IN GRAVEYARD AT PERROS. BLUE
     
    			This is a country graveyard beside a little church
    			in Brittany and it must be so conceived that it 
    			will seem reasonable to appear it joins the 
    			garden. Skeletons and skulls by the hundreds are 
    			heaped against the wall of the church. The full
    			moon throws its light upon the scene.  Christine
    			enters like a sleeping walker and picks her way
    			amongst the graves. Raoul enters a short distance 
    			behind and follows her at a distance. Christine 
    			finally stops before a grave with a moss covered 
    			headstone and kneels.

    			Christine's face is radiant. She turns and winds 
    			her way out of the graveyard and she is in the same 
    			mood that she entered. Raoul's eyes follow Christine 
    			for a second. Then again he begins to search for 
    			the source of the music with his eyes. He 
    			thinks he hears a noise in the direction of the bone 
    			heap and he takes two or three steps in this 
    			direction.
     
    246.			ANOTHER SHOT. BLUE.
    
    			This is shooting upon Raoul's back with the bone-

    			Raoul suddenly draws his sword and advances 
    			toward the wall. As he does so, one skull rolls

    			He is puzzled and in a measure horrified. A

    			expresses a friendly compassion for Raoul. The 
    			Persian then passes on toward the stage; Raoul

    			He watches intently.
     
     
    			CLOSE UP OF CHRISTINE BEFORE MIRROR.
     
    			She stretches out her arms toward the mirror and

    				"I AM HERE, ANGEL OF MUSIC."
     
    
    			BACK: The glass begins to quiver. A dozen images
    			of Christine are seen, all quivering. Christine 
    			herself is terrified. She gropes blindly at 
    			a long white drape hanging beside the mirror.
    			The terrified Christine disappears through the mirror 
    			and is gone with the mirror hanging and the 
    			torn drape with her.

    			Raoul runs into the room from the closet. He
    			pounds at the glass with his fists. He tries to
    			move it. He strikes at the walls wildly.  Then,
    			worn out, empty-brained, he takes up a chair and
    			with all his strength, hurls it at the mirror.
    			The chair is shattered and the mirror uninjured.
    			Then exhausted, he sinks down upon the couch and
    			buries his face in his hands.
     
    
    			INT. PASSAGEWAY. BACK OF MIRROR (FAINT GREEN)
     
    			Christine finds herself in a gloomy passage 
    			lighted by a single ray of light which comes 
    			from some unseen source.  Christine clutches the 
    			drapes - bewildered and terrified - but she does
    			not cry out. She looks ahead of her in the
    			direction of the improvised runway, but she does
    			not look directly downward. Then she turns to
    			the mysterious door thru which she has just 
    			entered. Near her from below a long arm is
    			extended into the scene. The fingers of the hand 
    			are held close together, stiff and straight. The
    			hand itself is not made up for a skeleton's hand, 
    			but merely to suggest one slightly. Then, without 
    			a step, the figure of Erick moves upward into 
    			scene, without motion on his part as if he were 
    			being lifted upon an elevator. Erick wears 
    			a black mask covering his eyes and nose.  The 
    			eyes seem to be two black holes. The part of 
    			the face that is visible, the chin and the 
    			mouth, is hideous. There is practically no 
    			hair on the head. He is dressed all in black,
    			his own peculiar fashion of evening
    			clothes. The whole is covered by a long black
    			cloak.
     
    			Erick extends his hand and grasps Christine by
    			the wrist. She stands motionless, burned to 
    			stone, but does not turn her eyes upon him yet.
    
     
    				A STONE COLD HAND THAT

    			BACK: Christine screams in sudden hysterical 
    			terror and looks up into his face. She screams
    			and begins to fight him hysterically. This 
    			scene is played very rapidly.
     
     
    			A LONGER SHOT.  FAINT GREEN
    
    			This shot shows an improvised runway with the
    			exit in the left f.g. In the b.g. can be seen
    			the machinery of the mirror, the two counter- 
    			pieces, etc. One of Erick's feet is still 
    			resting upon one of the counterpieces to explain 
    			how he came to be elevated into the picture. 
    			He rode up upon the moving counterpiece. 
    			Christine is fighting him hysterically. He takes 
    			her bodily in his arms. The drape is partially 
    			folded about her.
     
     
    			CLOSE UP ERICK & CHRISTINE.  FAINT GREEN
     
    			As Christine struggles and screams, Erick's 
    			skeleton hand closes over her mouth. When her 
    			horrified eyes catch sight of Erick's face 
    			close to hers, she partially swoons but does not
    			entirely lose consciousness. (This screaming is
    			employed to key the scene down so that it can
    			again be keyed up when Christine enters Erick's
    			abode.)  There must be this transition here,
    			because if Christine continues to oppose
    			Erick, she would not sit willingly upon the
    			white stallion nor row quietly in his arms in
    			the boat.
    
     
    			A LONGER SHOT. FAINT GREEN.
    
    			Christine in his arms, Erick sweeps over the

    			Erick swoops in on the bridge from the right, 
    			carrying Christine, the drape floating behind
    			them. Christine is pliable in his arms,
    			half in a swoon. Christine is reluctant. Erick exits
    			with her to the left. The scene changes by employ-
    			ing a traveling iris. As one picture irises out
    			of one corner,
    
    			the next simultaneously irises in another. 
    			Thus there is not an instant of blank screen. 
    			These irises should always travel in the
    			direction of the action. (It is suggested
    			that in each of these lapses, the fade-outs 
    			be taken three ways, by lap dissolving, fading 
    			and the moving iris.)

    			With a gliding motion, Erick, Christine in his
    			arms, moves to the horse. As he lifts her upon
    			the horse's back, Christine mildly resists, but
    			fixes herself upon the horse, and remains there.

    			This shows diagonal runways leading from one 
    			cellar to another. Erick leading the horse 
    			carrying Christine, is in the middle cellar 
    			of the three.  He leads the horse around the 
    			turn and starts down the runway toward the 
    			bottom cellar.  MOVING IRIS OUT.
     
     
    			INT. ON LAKE #1 FAINT GREEN
     
    			This first shot is looking from the distance 
    			over the still waters to the approach in the
    			b.g.  Behind the boat and the landing place,
    			there is quite a deep view into the cellar 
    			approach. This is for the end drama with the
    			mob. A boat, moored in front of this approach,
    			has a fantastic shape, say a Venetian line, and 
    			is painted black.
     
    			Erick enters leading horse. This is all in b.g.
    			He places the light in the boat, takes Christine
    			in his arms and as he does so, the horse exits as 
    			if by habit. Erick steps into the boat with
    			Christine and the drape. With his free hand, he
    			takes a long pole and gives the boat one shove. He 
    			glides toward the camera into the darkness, the 
    			drape floating upon the water in its wake.
     
    
    			LAKE SHOT NO.2  FAINT GREEN
     
    			This is the big lake shot. This shoots from the 
    			light into the darkness. The boat glides in from 
    			the darkness, the figure in it motionless. The 
    			boat glides up to two or three stone steps before 
    			a deep stone casemented door in the masonry on 
    			the left. The boat comes to a stop before the 
    			steps. Erick pulls a ring attached to a heavy 
    			chain, hanging from a hole in the masonry. The
    			heavy door swings open and Erick and Christine
    			is lying in his arms as a flood of dazzling light
    			shows she is in his arms limply and without any 
    			movement of resistance. She is like one in a dream or 
    			stupor. Erick carries her from the boat through 
    			the door.

    			5 - A Spanish chest which contains: the Cricket
    			and the Grasshopper.
     
    			6 - A trap door on the floor opening upon steps

    			7 - The hidden opening to Erick's secret passage
    			and stairs by which Erick leaves the house by a
    			route other than by the lake.
    
    			8 - A sounding device upon the wall.
     
    			This room is artistically arranged.
    			This suite of rooms is in the very foundation of
    			the opera house. Thousands of tons of masonry is
    			above and are being upheld by the arches and walls
    			of the room.  There is nothing of fantasy in the
    			actual lines and construction of the suite. The 
    			fantastic is applied by Erick's hand in the
    			lighting, furnishings and draperies.
     
    			Artistically arranged with many variations of
    			freshly cut flowers. Each of the furnishings
    			is old-fashioned, the idea being that it belonged
    			to Erick's mother. The couch is very light,
    			much higher than an ordinary couch.
     
    			Erick enters carrying Christine. He crosses the
    			room to the high couch and gently places her upon
    			it. He then returns to the door and closes it.
    			Christine's stupor is giving way to astonishment
    			and bewilderment. She begins to look at the
    			strange room when Erick returns to her. She still
    			is not sufficiently recovered from her stupor to
    			be startled and shocked by Erick's approach. He
    			observes her for an instant with folded arms in an
    			attitude of humility.

    			and then to his lips. Christine is watching him

    			and terrified scream. She springs from the couch.

    			In the middle of the room there is a canopy from
    			which hangs curtains of red brocaded stuff.  Under
    			this canopy there is an open coffin, an elaborate
    			affair lined with wuffed silk.  It is fantastic
    			but must look like a coffin - the lid is open. 
    			When Christine enters the coffin is not seen. 
    			She enters and stands frozen to the spot. Her 
    			wildness gives way to a dumb terror. The 
    			camera pans revealing the coffin and the canopy, 
    			but keeping Christine in the scene.  Erick enters
    			to her side in a quiet humble way.  Indicating 
    			the coffin, he tells her in a matter-of-fact way:
    
    
    				"THIS IS WHERE I SLEEP."
     
     
    			BACK: She looks at him with quiet horror and 
    			incredulity. She begins to get an idea. It begins 
    			to force itself upon her.  Erick continues:
    
    
    				"ONE HAS TO GET USED TO EVERYTHING 
    				IN LIFE, NEVER TO ETERNITY."
     
    
    			MED. CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AND ERICK. AMBER
    
    			The shot cuts out the coffin. Christine's 
    			terrified eyes are now fastened intently upon 
    			Erick's face. The thought that has forced
    			itself upon her, is a revelation to her. She 
    			cries at him with loathing:
    
     
    				"YOU ARE NOT THE ANGEL OF MUSIC....
    				YOU ARE THE OPERA GHOST!"
    
     
    			BACK: Erick ignores this. He indicates toward 
    			the coffin, "This is not a pleasant sight for you. 
    			You had better go into the next room." 
    			Christine here begins a transition. From the 
    			positive, assuming attitude, one of hopelessness 
    			and fear begins to envelope her. She begins 
    			to tremble and without removing her eyes from 
    			his face, backs into the drawing room.
     
    
    			INT. ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM  AMBER.
     
    			Christine enters from Erick's bed chamber to the
    			center of the room. She is now a pathetic, 
    			helpless little figure, hopeless, without under-
    			standing of what is to happen to her and trembling 
    			with fear.  Erick enters from his bedchamber and 
    			goes to her with a humble stoop of the shoulders. 
    			He stands before her an instant in an abject attitude.
     
     
    			INT. ERIK'S DRAWING ROOM  AMBER
    
    			Erick seems to fully understand her attitude. He
    			tells her humbly: 
     
    
    				"CHRISTINE, YOU MUST KNOW THE TRUTH. 
    				I'M NOT A GHOST...NOR AN ANGEL OF 
    				MUSIC..."
     
    
    			BACK:  She is wide-eyed and motionless and remains 
    			this way throughout the scene. Erick continues 
    			sadly:
     
    
    				"JUST A MAN OF FLESH AND BLOOD.... 
    				I AM ERICK!"
     
     
    			BACK: Christine is stunned by this knowledge
    			for she recognizes the voice. She says angrily
    			though frightened:
     
    
    				"IF YOU ARE HUMAN, REMOVE THAT MASK 
    				SO THAT I MAY SEE YOUR FACE."
     
    
    			BACK: Erik recoils in alarm and takes a step
    			backward.
    
    
    			C.V. ERIK.
     
    			His face and frame tremble with emotion as he answers
     
    
    				"YOU SHALL NEVER SEE ERIK'S FACE... 
    				UNLESS YOU RESIGN YOURSELF TO THE
    				FATE OF NEVER AGAIN SEEING THE 
    				LIGHT OF DAY"
    
     
    			INT ERIK'S DRAWING ROOM.
     
    			Christine is terrified...she becomes hysterical 
    			and sinking to her knees, pleads with him to 
    			release her - to take her home.  Instead, Erik 
    			gazes at her with folded arms and he says with
    			tragic sadness:
     
    
    				"I LOVE YOU CHRISTINE....I HAVE 
    				BROUGHT YOU HERE A PRISONER..."
     
     
    			BACK: There is a movement of Christine's eyes,
    			something to indicate terrible suspense...He 
    			continues the title, humbly:
     
     
    				"...FOR LOVE!"
     
    
    			BACK: Christine's hands go to her temples. She
    			totters an instant - then swoons. As she falls,
    			he catches her in his arms and allows her to 
    			sink gently to the floor. He kneels beside her 
    			and sways and moans and beats his chest and 
    			groveling, he kisses the hem of her garment. 
    			Slowly then Christine regains consciousness. She
    			is at first terrified; then as he sees the 
    			tragic outpouring of a sublime love, she can only 
    			feel pity for the strange creature who weeps and 
    			beats his breast. When Erik sees she is 
    			conscious, he seizes her hands and covers them 
    			with burning kisses. Christine draws away and
    			says:
     
    
    				"I CAN ONLY DESPISE YOU, IF YOU 
    				HOLD ME HERE AGAINST MY WILL."
     
       
    			C.V. OF ERIK
    
    			As he realizes that there is truth in her 
    			statement. The fear of losing her is as 
    			great as his love. He grovels at her feet and 
    			pleads:
     
     
    				"AT THE END OF FIVE DAYS, YOU SHALL 
    				BE FREE....FEAR NOT. FOR HE WHO 
    				WORSHIPS YOU I AS I DO, ALSO RESPECTS!"
     
     
    			INT. ERIK'S DRAWING ROOM.
    
    			Christine sinks back with a hopeless sigh and 
    			offers no resistance, when he tenderly picks her
    			up in his arms.
     
    
    			A LOWER SHOT...AMBER.
     
    			Erik takes Christine in his arms and carries 
    			her into her bedroom.
     
     
    			INT CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM...AMBER
     
    			The room is dimly lighted and all that is seen
    			is the dim outline of a bed and a door. This is
    			an extraordinary bed, a something dramatic, something
    			that does not exist. Erik enters with Christine
    			and places her gently upon the bed. He stands
    			for an instant in the doorway in silhouette and 
    			looks at her, then exits and closes the door. 
    			Christine arises to a sitting position.
     
    
    			C.V. OF CHRISTINE.
     
    			The reaction to her various emotions comes over
    			her. She bursts into tears and buries her 
    			head in the silken pillow.

    			A curious crowd are gathered near the stage door kept in

    			BACK: Erick moves closer to Christine as if he is

    			hands to warn him off. This brings Christine to
    			herself. Somethings has been revealed and it sha-
    			dows the tone of the scene. Up to this moment Chris-

    			of the music now dispelled and she begins to look 
    			at the man with curiosity and increasing antagonism-- 
    			then as his horrid face comes closer and closer, she 
    			suddenly seizes the mask and tears it from his face--
    			then repelled against the wall with a scream of terror

    			contorted with a hideous grin, then he stops, 
    			pulls backward laughing wildly. Her hair is lopsided
    			and streaming over her shoulder. Torn by uncontrolled
    			hysteria, tears, she raises to him appealing and makes
    			two steps forward, upon her knees, begging forgiveness
    			for the terrible thing she has done. He is towering 
    			over her with folded arms, his face slowly loosing
    			his hideous grin and mourning convulsively as the

    			many are in evening dress and wear opera masks. 
    			It is a scene of noise, laughter and color, gaiety 
    			and emotion. On the left side of the staircase,

    			from the center door. He is costumed as a swash-

    			see he wears a broadsword and all the other finery. 
    			His mask has the habit of falling off. Sometimes

    			Florine has not been quick enough with his mask how-

    			are friends of his and like teasing and playing around 
    			with him. Two of them take him, each by the arm and 
    			lightly kid with him for an instant, then leads him 
    			out to the left. All the while Florine is swashing

    			An aisle is made and Florine runs in fleeing for his 
    			life. When he reaches the turn on the platform, he
    			gets his legs tangled up with his broadsword and he

    			has seen her and Raoul. Her action shows that there 
    			is fear and excitement. She clutches him by the sleeve
    			and half drags him through the door in the rear which
    			reveals a stairway going upward.

    			The Red Death is looking upward. We now see him
    			creep up the grand staircase, much more rapidly than 
    			he came down, the crowd parting before him, making 
    			an aisle. When he reaches the landing he turns to 
    			the left.

    			is resumed.
     
     
    			INT  FIRST CORRIDOR  AMBER
     
    			This is an overhead corridor. A flight of stairs in

    			case is a high area, almost into the top of the ceiling 
    			so that the camera while taking in the people looks a 
    			long distance up the stairs. If a person were coming 
    			down these stairs, their lower extremities would be 
    			seen some time before the full figure. In the f.g. 
    			there is a door covered with a portierre. Immediately

    			is a door and number of other exits. Raoul and

    			and almost drags him along. Raoul is extrapolating 
    			with her excitedly - He wants to know what all the 
    			mad rushing about is for.
     
    			Christine has the manner of a hunted person. Hardly 
    			listening to Raoul's excited cry for an explanation 
    			she pauses at the portierres and listens.

    				"HE MUST HAVE GONE HIGHER UP."
     
     
    			BACK: Raoul is baffled, amazed, impatient for an ex-
    			planation. Christine listens at the portierre, this
    			time with sudden alarm. This time she speaks directly
    			at Raoul.
     
    
    				"HE IS COMING DOWN AGAIN."

    			four exits in this set. Christine and Raoul enter 
    			from below. Christine is still pulling at his arm. 
    			He will go no further. He glances down the steps that
    			they have just mounted.
    
    
    			SHOOTING DOWN NARROW STAIRWAY
     
    			This is shooting in the corridor number one. The

    			So this is the sum of Christine's fears. This is
    			an object for Raoul's anger. He moves towards the stair 
    			with a purpose of provoking this phantom and laying
    			hands upon him. Christine is thrown into near 
    			hysterics. She clutches at Raoul's arm. He now has
    			one foot upon the stairs. He is drawing away from 
    			her and in so doing he pulls her to her knees.

    				RAOUL. IT WILL MEAN YOUR LIFE AND MINE"
     
     
    			BACK:  Raoul undergoes a complete transition. What 
    			she has said hits him violently and with great weight. 
    			He sees her before him a helpless pathetic little 
    			figure. He feels the utmost pity and love for her. 
    			Gently he takes her by the elbow and lifts her to her 
    			feet. She indicates to him weakly "Come"

    			Christine and Raoul enter from garret set. Christine
    			is greatly relieved. She breathes in the freedom of 
    			the night air and as she removes her mask Raoul 
    			removes his mask and she tells him:
     
    
    				"BELOW IS HIS WORLD   ABOVE IT OURS."
     
    
    			BACK: In a gray way Raoul pauses and presses her for

    				THE BEAUTIFUL VOICE IN MY DRESSING ROOM 
    				I BELIEVED IT TO BE THE ANGEL OF MUSIC."

    			there is none. Raoul is burning up inside with
    			jealousy - guilty jealousy. Christine has been so 
    			engrossed in her terrible story that she has not 
    			understood his attitude. She is shocked now as an 
    			understanding of Raoul's suspicions comes to her. 
    			Her lips tremble and she feels helpless and alone. 
    			She is almost at the point of tears. She tries to get 
    			his eyes but he averts them. She touches him upon

    				"RAOUL DO YOU THINK THAT I AM NOT 
    				A GOOD WOMAN? DO YOU NOT LOVE ME?"

    			INT CELLAR SHOOTING AGAINST BLANK WALL  #2  FAINT GREEN
     
    			Raoul and the Persian enter - They look off and stop 
    			-both transfixed with terror - They flatten themselves 
    			against the wall as the Persian makes his lantern 
    			dark. A fiery face - not more than three feet from 
    			the ground approaches, a red handkerchief - Handschiegel 
    			Process - is around the neck giving the impression 
    			that it is a decapitated head. When the terrible 
    			face reaches a point opposite Raoul and the Persian
    			it cries out at them:
     
    
    				"DON'T MOVE...WHATEVER YOU DO... 
    				I'M THE RAT CATCHER. LET ME PASS 
    				WITH MY RATS."
     
     
    			BACK: The face exits. The light upon the face is 
    			caused by a dark lantern which the rat catcher holds 
    			turned upon himself. The Persian turns on his lantern 
    			and he and Raoul exit, looking back with terrified 
    			eyes, their right hands up in the air.

    				"YOU MUST NOW MAKE YOUR CHOICE! 
    				...THE WEDDING MASS OR THE REQUIEM
    				MASS?"
    
    
    			BACK: Christine breaks into tears, repeating, "No!
    			No! No!" Her tears touch Erick. He cannot stand them.

    			Erick kneels and appeals to her:
     
    
    				"DON'T CRY...IT GIVES ME PAIN!
    
    
    			BACK: This causes Christine to cry all the more-
    			bitterly - then he tells her in a pathetic reasoning
    			way:
     
    
    				"I WANT TO HAVE A WIFE LIKE EVERYBODY 
    				ELSE AND TAKE HER OUT ON SUNDAYS."
     
     
    			BACK: Christine cowers away from him like a broken 
    			spirited animal as far away as the couch will allow. 
    			His mood changes again - he rises in a rage - He is 
    			infuriated at himself and his position.
     
    
    			A LONGER SHOT...AMBER:
     
    			He beats his chest and cries at her:

    				WITH A FALSE BOTTOM."

    			This is a low massive chamber. It is almost at the 
    			bottom of the opera foundations, leading from it is
    			a long narrow corridor, wide enough only for two 
    			men to walk abreast. This first shot does not reveal 
    			the narrow corridor. Raoul and the Persian enter. 
    			The Persian stops and listens. Raoul tiredly lets 
    			down his right hand. In a startled way, the Persian 
    			grabs Raoul's wrist and raises his right arm for 
    			him, with a certain horror in his look.
     
    
    				"KEEP YOUR HANDS UP! THIS IS THE ONLY 
    				WAY TO THROW OFF THE STRANGLER'S LASSO."

    				"WE ARE NEAR HIS HOUSE NOW."
     
    
    			BACK: The Persian cautions Raoul to move quietly.
    			They reach a point just inside the corridor.
    			Without any anticipation a trap gives under their

    			The picture is held on an instant and the trap closed.
     
     
    			INT TORTURE CHAMBER. ...FAINT GREEN
     
    			The source of light is the Persian's lantern. 
    			In relation to Erick's living room this chamber is 
    			to the left. It is a six-cornered room, the sides 
    			of which are covered with mirrors from top to 
    			bottom. The chamber is very high and the ceiling 
    			never seen. In one corner is an iron tree with 
    			an iron branch. Upon the branch is hanging a 
    			strangler's lasso. The multiple reflections of the
    			tree gives the effect of a forest, in the mirrors.
    			Out of reach of anyone is the torture chamber and 
    			out of the picture in the right top wall is an 
    			aperture opening into Erick's living room, an opening
    			through which a person in the living room can see into
    			the torture chamber. Ben Carre is working out the
    			details of this chamber.
      
    			There is no effect of a reflected forest until 
    			Erick turns on the overhead lights. The dark lantern 
    			would not cause those multiple reflections. The 
    			Persian gets to his feet, turns lantern to 
    			mirrors and feels them. Then examines iron tree and
    			lasso - turns to Raoul, recovering from fall and says:
    
    
    				"WE HAVE DROPPED INTO ONE OF THE 
    				TORTURE CHAMBERS OF THE OLD COMMUNE.
    				IF ERICK DISCOVERS US, MAY GOD HAVE 
    				MERCY ON OUR SOULS!"
     
    
    			BACK: Raoul's reaction is horror. Suddenly both men 
    			are startled and look up and to the right. They 
    			hear Erick's voice. Raoul is thrown into great 
    			terror and opens his mouth to cry out but the Persian 
    			grabs Raoul and puts his hand over Raoul's mouth.

    			of heavy material closely woven from wire and
    			locked with a fancy weird sort of padlock. Erick is
    			standing below Christine, Erick is making love to 
    			her, in his way, and Christine is flattened against
    			the wall crying hysterically.
    			Erick is not touching her but close to and below

    			Raoul is in agony and struggles with the Persian
    			who tries to get it over to him that it will mean his

    			CLOSE OF QUEER SOUNDING DEVICE...AMBER
    
    			This is a weird, oriental, beautifully tooled 
    			affair. There are three bars such as are used in 
    			chimes. An arm about 18 inches long systematically 
    			strikes the chimes - all three at once. This 
    			sounding device is placed in a prominent place in 
    			the room and continues striking regularly through 
    			the next number of scenes. This is for the dramatic 
    			affect of its stopping at the proper moment.
     
    
    			CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AND ERICK.  AMBER
     
    			Erick, realizes that opposition is now at hand and
    			a satanic smile overspreads his horrible face,

    				"SOMEBODY IS RINGING! WE 
    				HAVE CALLERS!"
     
     
    			BACK: Christine's first reaction is one of relief.
    			Help is at hand. Then almost instantly she is
    			thrown into anguish. Her lips form the name "Raoul" 
    			Erick studies her for an instant and then moves out.
    			Swiftly.

    			The arm is rhythmically falling upon the chime. 
    			Erick moves to a beautiful throw hanging over the 
    			back of a chair, sweeps it off. Swiftly he begins 
    			to bind Christine to the center pillar.
    
    
    			MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE...AMBER
     
    			She offers no resistance. The throw passes around 
    			Christine's waist and is tied on the side of the pillar

    				"FORGIVE ME...THIS IS TO SAVE YOU 
    				FROM HARMING YOURSELF."
     
    
    			A LONG SHOT. AMBER

    			LAKE SET LOOKING FROM ERICK'S ROOM FAINT GREEN
     
    			The boat is discovered here. Erick enters from 
    			his drawing room. From a rack he takes up a metal
    			tube, the shape of a reed, about four feet long 
    			and less than half an inch in diameter. Erick
    			puts one end of this tube in his mouth and swiftly 
    			walks down into the water. As he walks he goes down 
    			and down until his head disappears and only the 
    			ripple caused by the end of the gliding reed is 
    			seen. This ripple moves away with remarkable swiftness.

    			This is medium closeup of Philippe at the boat landing.
    			Philippe is kneeling, holding up the lantern, peering
    			into the darkness. He shouts Raoul's name. Unseen by
    			Philippe and directly in front of him there is a dis-
    			turbance in the water. The reed-like tube glides in
    			making a V-shaped line of ripples. Then Erick's

    			From this moment Christine begins to act a 
    			double role. She is now matching her wits against

    			fail to notice his wet clothes and the mystery 
    			behind his absence. Erick now drops his sardonic 
    			mood which caused the last title. As he releases her

    			what this means. The torture has begun. The 
    			sudden flood of brilliant light causes them to blink. 
    			Then Raoul tries to hide his eyes from the brilliant,

    			(In this scene begins the gathering of the mob, it 
    			must not have the appearance of an open revolt against 
    			constituted authority. It is rather the quiet myster- 
    			ious gathering of about five hundred men, under the 
    			very eyes of the police. Until they begin rushing 
    			wild in the opera, they must do everything to con-
    			ceal their designs from the police. Mob psychology 
    			is only suggested here and allowed to grow to 
    			dramatic proportions later.)
    			This is a general view of the street. The streets 
    			are wet. It has just stopped raining. The streets 
    			glisten from the lights reflected on the pavement. 
    			Only about half the mob is shown here. The men are 
    			gathering in small groups, not more than ten in a 
    			group. The groups are so placed as to be near exits 
    			for a sudden disappearance effect. A nervous buzz
    			of suppressed excitement prevails. The center of
    			the scene is a dark doorway around which the largest
    			group is gathered. Beside the door is a flight of 
    			steps leading down into a dark cellar. Standing
    			beside this door is Simon with Florine. Mysterious 
    			packages (torches) the contents of which are not shown 
    			to the audience, are passed out of the doorway and 
    			instantly secreted under the coats of the receivers. 
    			The mysterious packages are being distributed among
    			the other groups, and in each case are instantly 
    			secreted.
     
     
    			MED CLOSE UP CENTER GROUP  BLUE
     
    			A fanatical fire shines from Simon's eyes, as he
    			directs the distribution of the mysterious packages. 
    			The packages are passed out of the doorway. Florine's 
    			attention is concentrated upon a deaf man. He is 
    			shouting in the man's ear, trying to make him under-
    			stand something.
     
     
    			ANOTHER SHOT  BLUE
     
    			This is shooting down the street upon the mob. 
    			In the f.g. is a cross-road. One of the mob is
    			picketed on the corner to keep an eye out for 
    			the police. A gendarme approaches upon the cross 
    			street. He will not be in a position to catch 
    			sight of the mob until he reaches the corner. 
    			The picket spots him.

    			yelling at the deaf man, get the signal. 
    
     
    			SHOOTING DOWN STREET TOWARD CROSS ROAD  BLUE
     
    			The mob melts and disappears - vanishes. The 
    			door through which the packages were being passed 
    			closes. This leaves Florine alone yelling at the 
    			deaf man. The deaf man sees and he too disappears. 
    			Florine looks around and finds himself all alone. 
    			He runs down into the cellar just as the gendarme
    			rounds the corner and takes a diagonal course
    			across the street. Florine fairly bounces, flies 
    			out of the cellar. The idea is that he has been 
    			confronted by something terrible in the 
    			cellars - just as rapidly as he comes out. The 
    			gendarme, however, does not see him and exits. The
    			door opens, Simon enters and the mob reappears, just
    			as rapidly as it faded away. Florine enters 
    			from the cellar, sort of creeping up backwards 
    			looking into the dark hole with fright. Simon gives
    			an order to move. He conceals a package and gives it 
    			to Florine. Florine's package sticks up about a 
    			foot back of his head in plain sight. The mob moves.

    			to her she cannot tell him flatly "No" 
    			Therefore she continues her acting, depending upon 
    			evasions. At the same time she is in trembling 
    			and fear for Raoul. What is being done to him? 
    			Erick is frenzied and insistent. Christine is hard 
    			pressed. He follows her into a corner and is telling 
    			her with frenzied pain:

    			and is mechanically searching for the secret

    			SHOOTING INTO MIRRORS  RED. 
     
    			The reflected forest has assumed the aspect of 
    			a real tropical forest. A forest fire is raging 
    			and is being blown by a strong wind which is

    			and clutches at his cloak, crying, "What are you 
    			doing to him! What are you doing to him!" With a

    			begins to tap the big pillar with a small iron bar. 
    			He suddenly cries out that it is hollow. He taps it 
    			and all listen to the hollow sound. One man with a

    			love me!"  Christine is groggy - she has the intention 
    			of telling Erick, "Take me!" but her emotions have
    			exhausted her. She is almost out of her mind. Her
