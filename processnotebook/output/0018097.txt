    TITLE:
    
    	In rural England--
    	a forsaken garden--
      
    1.
    FADE IN:
    EXT. BALFOUR GARDEN (NIGHT) PERAMBULATOR SHOT 
    The camera is stationary as the fade comes in: through a 
    tangle of brush can be seen in the night, four dark 
    figures, one of them carrying a lantern. They are 
    evidently searching for something. They come toward 
    camera through a garden long neglected ... gone into ruin. 
    As they reach foreground the camera moves with them. They 
    are men of the English servant class: a gardener and some 
    hostlers. The gardener; who carries the lantern searches 
    the ground ahead of them as they stumble forward, 
    frightened. It isn't a job that they relish.
     
    				LAP DISSOLVE INTO:
     
    EXT: BALFOUR GARDEN AND HOUSE (NIGHT)  LONG SHOT 
    A Newcomb shot of the house of the English country type in 
    a state of decay quite as sad as that of the garden. 
    Windows are broken, shutters loose; it is bleak, desolate. 
    The dim figures of the men with their lantern are 
    approaching from b. g. a corner of the house.
     
    				LAP DISSOLVE INTO:
     
    EXT. CORNER HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT 
    The men coming into scene, stop suddenly, startled.
     
    INSERT:
     
    	CLOSEUP, a shutter hanging loose 
    	on rusty hinges, banging back and 
    	forth in a gust of wind.
    
    BACK TO SCENE: The men as they shudder. One of them trying 
    to conquer the fear that holds them, points up, telling 
    them it was only a shutter in the wind. The gardener with 
    the lantern indicates for them to press forward. They start,
    around the corner of the house.
     
    2.
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  MEDIUM SHOT 
    Around corner, lying crumpled, still and lifeless in f.g.
    is the body of a man. The men come around the corner with 
    the lantern. They stop short in horror. The man with the 
    lantern leans over the body. The others huddle with scared 
    faces around him.
    
    3.
    EXT. BALFOUR  (NIGHT)  CLOSEUP
    The men, with the body below frame line. The gardener, 
    holding the lantern so that he can see, looks down and out 
    of scene as though at the face of the dead man. He looks up 
    at the others and says in an awed whisper:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"It's _'im_. It's _'arry Balfour_" 
    
    BACK TO SCENE: The men look at each other in awe. One of 
    them shakes his head slowly and says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"This'll break 'is sister 
    	Lucy's 'eart"
     
    BACK TO SCENE. There is solemn assent to this.
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"And 'ow about Sir James? 
    	Him as loved 'em both like 
    	they was 'is own children."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Again there is solemn assent.
     
    				QUICK FADE OUT
    
    4.
    QUICK FADE IN:  EXT. HAMLIN HOUSE  (NIGHT)  LONG SHOT
    A Newcomb shot of another English country house, this one 
    with lighted windows and well-kept grounds, a distinct 
    contrast to the ruin just seen. Run only a few feet for 
    swift, impressionistic effect and
     
    				LAP DISSOLVE INTO:
     
    INT. HAMLIN MUSIC ROOM   (NIGHT)   FULL SHOT
    Again the sense of contrast. Here are warmth, wealth, 
    comfort. Seated at a piano is Lucy Balfour, a pretty English 
    girl in her early twenties. Standing listening to her, as 
    she plays, is Sir James Hamlin, a dignified, kindly country 
    gentleman in his late forties.
     
    				LAP DISSOLVE INTO:
     
    INT. HAMLIN MUSIC ROOM   (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Lucy and Sir James, as she finishes playing and looks up at 
    him with a wistful smile. He indicates for her to play 
    something more. She selected a piece and is startled when a 
    little worried look crosses her face and she looks up at 
    him and says:
    
    TITLE:
     
     	"I simply can't understand, 
    	Sir James, why Harry went 
    	away without saying anything."
     
    				CUT FROM TITLE TO:
     
    5.
    INT HAMLIN MUSIC ROOM  (NIGHT)  CLOSEUP
    Lucy as she finishes title, a pretty puzzlement in her 
    expression. It is apparent that she is not greatly worried, 
    just perplexed.
     
    6.
    INT. HAMLIN MUSIC ROOM  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    Sir James, as he smiles down at her gravely, a deep 
    affection in his eyes, and says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"There is nothing to worry about, 
    	Lucy, my dear."
     
    				CUT FROM TITLE TO:
    
    7.
    INT HAMLIN MUSIC ROOM SHOT  (NIGHT)  CLOSE
    The two at the piano, as Sir James finishes reaching over 
    and patting Lucy's hand affectionately. After a moment she 
    resumes her playing. He stands watching her, then turns 
    thoughtfully and goes out of scene.
     
    8.
    INT. HAMLIN MUSIC ROOM  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    By arched entrance to hall, as Sir James comes thoughtfully 
    in and pulls a long bell-cord. A butler enters. With a look 
    off toward Lucy, Sir James gives a quiet order to the 
    butler.
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"Have my secretary come here."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: The butler exits. Sir James looks again off 
    toward Lucy. In a moment his secretary enters -- a young 
    man of the serious type, a student. Sir James asks him 
    quietly:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Any word, Mr. Hibbs?"
    
    BACK TO SCENE: Hibbs is about to answer, but looks off 
    toward Lucy and then gets over in pantomime that perhaps 
    they had better step into the hall. Sir James nods. They 
    exit.
     
    9.
    INT. HAMLIN HALL  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Other side of doorway as Sir James and Hibbs come in. Now 
    Hibbs tells him earnestly:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"I insisted, sir, on their 
    	searching the grounds over 
    	at the old Balfour place--"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Sir James nods gravely to this, indicating 
    that the secretary acted wisely, that that was the right 
    thing to do. Hibbs goes on.
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Weird things have happened 
    	there in the last five years--
    	ever since Miss Lucy's father--"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Sir James checks him with a gesture. Both 
    look off sharply down the hall.
     
    10 
    INT. HAMLIN HALL  (NIGHT)  MEDIUM SHOT 
    A maid, Miss Smithson, is standing at an open door, staring 
    out and down in horror. She screams, drawing back.
     
    11 
    INT. HAMLIN HALL  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Sir James and Hibbs, staring. They run out.
     
    12 
    INT. HAMLIN HALL  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT 
    Lucy. She stops playing, listens in sudden fright, then 
    rises and exits.
    
    13 
    INT. HAMLIN HALL  (NIGHT)  MEDIUM SHOT 
    At door, Sir James, Hibbs, Miss Smithson, the gardener and 
    a hostler. The gardener and the hostler are just 
    straightening up from having placed below frames line in 
    f.g. the body of the dead Harry Balfour. Sir James, leaning 
    over, straightens up gravely. The body is not seen.
     
    14 
    INT. HAMLIN HALL  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    At entrance to music room, as Lucy comes through, looks off, 
    screams and starts forward.
     
    15 
    INT. HAMLIN HALL  (NIGHT)  MEDIUM SHOT 
    At door, as before, as Lucy comes in from down the hall, 
    staring in horror at the body out of scene. "Harry! Harry!" 
    she cries. Sir James put an arm about her comfortingly for 
    a moment, leading her away a little, indicating for the 
    maid to take her away. Miss Smithson leads Lucy out of 
    scene. Sir James turns and gives an order to the butler, 
    who exits quickly. Sir James turns to the hostler and 
    others and gives orders. Hibbs, looking off after Lucy,  
    exits in that direction.  Sir James starts quickly up the 
    stairs.
     
    16 
    INT. HAMLIN LIBRARY  (NIGHT)  MEDIUM SHOT
    Lucy, on a couch, being comforted by the maid. Hibbs comes 
    slowly in, standing for a moment looking at them. At a 
    gesture from Hibbs, the maid quickly withdraws. Hibbs sits 
    on the couch beside Lucy.
     
    17 
    INT. LIBRARY CLOSEUP SHOT
    Hibbs and Lucy, as he sits on the couch beside her. She is 
    staring off with tragic face. Hibbs feels terribly about it 
    all. He would like to be able to speak a consoling word to 
    her, but he does not know just what to say or how to say it.
    Hesitatingly, he says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Miss Balfour, I-----" 
    
    BACK TO SCENE: She turns away to the end of the couch and 
    bursts into uncontrollable sobbing. Hibbs sits and looks at 
    her with the deepest sympathy and a sort of pathetic 
    helplessness.

    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  LONG SHOT
    Two men are seen dimly, standing under a tree. A jaunting 
    cart is driving slowly in, with the gardener and Miss 
    Smithson. The cart stops as they look off towards the 
    house. (The cart is loaded with trunks, baggage.)
    
    				LAP DISSOLVE INTO:
    
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  FULL SHOT
    Grand Staircases. Coming down the stairs are two figures, a 
    man and a woman. The man, who carries a lamp, is as strange 
    a creature as the eyes ever beheld. He wears a black beaver 
    hat and a black Inverness coat and his face has on it the 
    pallor of death. There is, indeed, something not of this 
    Earth in his appearance. Nor is the woman with him less 
    strange. Her face also is of an unearthly pallor. She is 
    garbed all in black, with long black sleeves to her cloak 
    that look like wings. They come the long walk down the 
    stairs. He hands the lamp to the woman. No word is spoken 
    between them. She starts off toward a side room. The man 
    goes slowly toward the front door.
     
    				LAP DISSOLVE INTO
     
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  LONG SHOT
    The jaunting cart in f.g., the two men at side under a tree. 
    A light passes a downstairs window. The Man in the Beaver 
    Hat comes out the front door. The gardener suddenly whips up 
    his steed and the cart goes out of scene pellmell.
     
    53 
    EXT. GARDEN  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT 
    The two men under the tree, two business-like Britishers, 
    one of whom has a legal document in his hand. The Man in the 
    Beaver Hat enters to them. One of the two men says to him:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"You'll pardon us, sir, for 
    	not going in with you, but..."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: He shudders a little, expressively. THE MAN 
    IN THE BEAVER HAT indicates the legal document without 
    speaking. The other man unfolds it. The Man in the Beaver 
    Hat takes out a fountain pen, indicating that he will sign. 
    The first man tells him:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Understand, sir, the 
    	owner will make no repairs."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: The Man in the Beaver Hat nods solemnly to 
    this and, without speaking, leans over and starts to sign 
    the document. The two look at him curiously, drawing back 
    from him a little, instinctively.
     
    54 
    EXT. HAMLIN HOUSE   (NIGHT)   LONG SHOT
    The jaunting cart with the gardener and maid driving 
    pellmell in, around the driveway, toward rear of house.
     
    55 
    INT. SERVANTS HALL  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT
    Hibbs, the secretary, is giving some orders to the butler. 
    Two or three other servants are present. Run a few feet. 
    Then the rear door is flung open and Miss Smithson, the 
    maid, comes excitedly in, starting at once to tell the 
    secretary and butler what she saw at the Balfour House. The 
    gardener follows. He nods a pop-eyed assent to everything 
    the maid is telling. Everybody present is much impressed, 
    including Hibbs, the secretary, who starts to question Miss 
    Smithson.  Suddenly all stop, tense, listening.
     
    INSERT:
     
    	CU bell indicator on wall. 
    	Bell is ringing. An arrow 
    	has dropped, indicating from 
    	what room.
     
    BACK TO SCENE: There is a sigh of relief. It was only a 
    call for the butler. He exits. Hibbs asks a couple of more 
    suggestions of Miss Smithson, then follows the butler out.
     
    56 
    INT. HAMLIN HALL   (NIGHT)   SEMI FULL SHOT
    Sir James and chauffeur. The chauffeur is closing the door, 
    depositing Sir James' bag on the floor as the butler comes 
    in. He is helping Sir James off with his coat as Hibbs, the 
    secretary, comes in. The Butler takes the coat and bag and 
    is about to start out with them when a ring is heard at the 
    front door. The butler puts down the bag and coat and opens 
    the front door, admitting the two agents seen under the 
    tree at the Balfour house. Sir James at the door to the 
    library, turns in some surprise. One of the agents, holding 
    up the lease, tells him:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"It's about a tenant, sir, 
    	for the old Balfour place."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: "A tenant?" Sir James is really surprised. 
    He indicates for the two men to step into the library. They 
    do so, followed by Hibbs.
     
    57 
    INT. LIBRARY   (NIGHT)   SEMI FULL SHOT
    Sir James goes to desk and sits down. The agent hands him 
    the lease. Hibbs stands at one side, in case he might be 
    needed. Sir James unfolds the document. One of the agents 
    says: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"I told him, sir, you'd make 
    	no repairs."

    INT. LIBRARY  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    At desk, as the agent finishes title. Sir James nods that 
    that was the right thing to do. Now, with the lease 
    unfolded, he scans down it with a business-like eye. 
    Suddenly he frowns, staring in astonishment down at the 
    document.
     
    INSERT:
     
    	Signature on lease:
     
    		ROGER BALFOUR
     
    				CUT FROM INSERT TO:
     
    59 
    INT. LIBRARY  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    Sir James, staring down at the signature. He looks up, his 
    lips forming the name: "Roger Balfour!" He looks up slowly. 
    Then, indicating the signature with a forefinger, he says, 
    slowly:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"This is the name of the man 
    	who committed suicide in that 
    	house five years ago!" 
    
    BACK TO SCENE: He finishes title, in awe and wonder.
     
    60 
    INT. LIBRARY  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP SHOT 
    The two agents, staring in astonishment.
     
    61 
    INT. LIBRARY  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    Hibbs, the secretary, as he says, involuntarily:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Lucy's father!"
     
    				CUT FROM TITLE TO:
     
    62

    of group as they stare at each other.
     
    63 
    INT. HAMLIN HALL  NIGHT CLOSE SHOT
    At front door. The butler is opening the door. Burke of 
    Scotland Yard, with a bag, stands there.
     
    TITLE:
    
    	"Tell Sir James an old friend -- 
    	just back from India -- has come 
    	to visit him."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Burke comes in; The butler closes the door 
    and exits toward the library.
     
    64
    INT. LIBRARY  NIGHT  SEMI FULL SHOT
    The group as before. The butler, stepping in from the 
    entrance hall, gives Sir James the Message. "An old 
    friend?" Sir James says, trying to recall who it might be; 
    and then, "Show him in." The butler exits. After a moment 
    he returns with Burke. Sir James rises from the desk. They 
    stand looking at each other for a moment, then Sir James 
    comes forward and they greet each other with the warmth and 
    cordiality of old friends long parted. Sir James then turns 
    to the others and says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Colonel Yates, gentlemen"
     
    				CUT FROM TITLE TO:
     
    65 
    INT. LIBRARY   NIGHT   MED. SHOT
    of group as Sir James finishes title. The introduction is 
    acknowledged with a bow, in which Burke allows his gaze to 
    rest in rather long scrutiny on Hibbs, the secretary, so 
    that the young man is beginning to be uncomfortable. Sir 
    James, picking up the lease, turns with it to Burke, with 
    a return of his excitement of a moment ago.
     
    66 
    INT. LIBRARY   NIGHT   CLOSE SHOT
    Sir James and Burke, as Sir James tells him swiftly of the 
    name signed to the lease. Burke smiles dryly and says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"A coincidence, Sir James -- it 
    	could be nothing more."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: This is what Sir James wants to believe and 
    is relieved when Burke says it. Burke turns to the two 
    agents out of scene and says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"I knew Roger Balfour well. 
    	What did this man look like?"
     
    				CUT FROM TITLE TO:
     
    67 
    INT. LIBRARY   NIGHT   CLOSE SHOT
    Group as Burke finishes question. The two agents exchange a 
    look. Then one of them says:
     
    TITLE:
     
     	"That's hard to say, sir.
    	There was something weird about 
    	him -- that made you feel creepy --"
     
    				CUT FROM TITLE TO:
     
    68 
    INT. LIBRARY   NIGHT   CLOSE UP
    The two agents as the first one finishes title in awe. The 
    other one goes on: 
    
    TITLE:
    
    	"Something like he wasn't of 
    	this Earth.... something unholy--"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: He finishes title. The other nods in 
    agreement to this.
     
    69 
    INT. LIBRARY   NIGHT   CLOSE SHOT
    Burke, looking out of scene at them for a moment with 
    penetrating glance. Then he laughs and says: 
    
    TITLE:
     
     	"Nonsense!"
    
    70 
    INT. LIBRARY   NIGHT   MED. SHOT
    Of group, as Burke finishes title, laughing. Sir James is 
    now a bit more at ease, but still nervous and upset. The 
    two agents look shamefaced and foolish. One of them gets 
    over to Sir James and says that if they are not needed any 
    more they'll be going. Sir James nods goodnight to them, 
    turning and indicating to Hibbs to show them out. Hibbs 
    exits with the two agents. Sir James sinks into his seat at 
    the desk. Burke draws up a chair.
     
    71 
    INT. LIBRARY   NIGHT   CLOSE SHOT
    Sir James and Burke at the desk as Burke sits down. Sir 
    James stares for a moment, frowning at the signature on the 
    lease. Then, with a sudden thought, he rummages in a drawer 
    of the desk and gets out a packet of papers. With nervous 
    fingers, he slips the rubber band off and examines the 
    signature attached. He places this beside the other and 
    shows the two of them to Burke.
     
    INSERT:
     
    	Two signatures, "Roger Balfour", 
    	along side each other. They very 
    	closely resemble each other.
     
    BACK TO SCENE: The two men look up from the document 
    seriously. For a moment, not a word is spoken between them. 
    Then Sir James says, in awe: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"The signatures are the same!" 
    
    BACK TO SCENE: Burke nods solemnly. "Yes."
     
    72 
    INT. MUSIC ROOM   NIGHT   MED. SHOT
    The room is dark, except for a shaft of moonlight from the 
    window. In this moonlight, Lucy, pale and beautiful in a 
    white dress, stands looking out into the garden. Hibbs 
    enters to her. She does not turn for a moment. Hibbs stands 
    looking at her for a moment, worried. Then he speaks to her, 
    softly. She turns, startled. Then, seeing it is Hibbs, she 
    says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"I thought I heard a voice calling 
    	to me from the garden -- ever so 
    	softly: 'Lucy--'"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Hibbs stares at her for a moment, then turns 
    and looks out into the garden. He turns back to her, 
    closing the casement window and tells her: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"There s no one there --
    	You're nervous, dear--"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: He finishes title. She smiles wanly. "Yes, 
    I'm nervous." He turns and starts to close the windows.
    
    73 
    INT. LIBRARY   NIGHT   CLOSE SHOT 
    Sir James and Burke, as Sir James talks to him, earnestly. 
    Burke, with a cynical smile, interrupts, saying: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"You mean a ghost, Sir James?" 
    
    BACK TO SCENE: Sir James shakes his head, solemnly. They 
    look at each other for a moment, then Sir James answers: 
    
    TITLE:
     
     	"Not a ghost, no! Worse than 
    	that--"
     
    				CUT FROM TITLE TO:
     
    74 
    INT. LIBRARY   NIGHT   MED. SHOT
    Sir James, finishes title, rises and takes down two or three 
    ancient looking books from the bookcases that line the 
    walls. He puts these on the desk, opens one of them, finds 
    a passage and shows it to Burke.
     
    75

    TITLE:
     
    	"We're not living in the Middle 
    	Ages, Sir James."
    
    CUT TO SCENE: Sir James is deeply thoughtful. He ponders 
    this for a moment, then says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Just the same, I'd like to have 
    	a look at the vault where Roger

    The open door of the mausoleum. Sir James and Burke stagger 
    backward out the door of the mausoleum. Burke has a pocket 
    flashlight in his hand. He clicks it off. They stare at 
    each other aghast. Then Sir James mutters, incredulously, 
    in horror:
     
    TITLE: 
    
    	"The coffin was _empty_!" 
    
    BACK TO SCENE: He finishes title. Burke nods slowly, 
    solemnly. Suddenly Sir James clutches at Burke's arm and 
    both men are tense, listening.

    only an owl." They turn to go.
     
    78 
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE AND GARDEN NIGHT  SEMI LONG SHOT
    The house and the ruined garden in weird lighting. At the 
    gate stand the Man in the Beaver Hat, the girl in black 
    with the sleeves that look like wings. These two are 
    welcoming three others -- three men as queer in appearance 
    as the man in the Beaver Hat and his companion. Not a word 
    is spoken. The whole effect is odd, fantastic. They start 
    toward the house, slowly, in solemn procession.

    Hibbs, Sir James and Burke. The Secretary is reading from 
    one of the old books to the other two men. Both of whom 
    seem to be profoundly impressed. He turns the page and is 
    instantly struck by what he encounters there. He spreads 
    the book open on the desk and calls their attention to it. 
    They lean over, seeing:

    Sir James and Burke, looking down at the illustration. 
    Burke looks up from it, in his eyes the faintest suggestion 
    of a cynical smile. Sir James looks at the page facing the 
    illustration and reads on for a few lines. There is a 
    strange excitement in his manner as he indicates to Burke 
    to read what he has just read. Burke looks down at the 
    page:
    
    INSERT:

    Burke, as he realizes the significance of this. There is a 
    moment when he seems deeply impressed. Then, with a sudden 
    change of manner, he says, vehemently:
     
    TITLE:
     
     	"My God, man, this is the

    TITLE:
    
    	"_I_ believe it!"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Burke turns a cold gaze on Hibbs. For a 
    moment it seems as if his eyes would bore through the 
    secretary. Then, with something of contempt in his final 
    appraisement, he turns to Sir James, who shrugs his 
    shoulders, as though to get over, "What can we believe?" 
    Suddenly all three are tense, listening. Burke says in a 
    whisper:
    
    TITLE:
     
     	"What was that?"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: They listen, tense, not moving a muscle.

    Miss Smithson, the maid, is backing away toward the door. 
    She has her hand clutched to her throat and is staring in 
    terror out of scene. She hears the hammering on the door. 
    She reaches the door, frantically turns the key. The door 
    is flung open. Hibbs, Sir James and Burke plunge into the 
    room. The maid has her hand to her throat in pain. They 
    stop, looking around the room out of scene. Sir James 
    cries out:

    turns the key in the door. Lucy, weak and faint from 
    fright, steps out. Sir James puts an arm about her, 
    supporting her. Speaking comfortingly to her, he starts out 
    with her toward an open window, out of scene. Hibbs looks 
    off after them, deep concern in his eyes.

    indicates for Hibbs to look. The secretary does so. He 
    looks up and he and Sir James stare at each other for a 
    solemn moment. "Well?" says Burke. Sir James tells him:

    EXT. UPPER BRANCHES  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Burke and Sir James as Burke turns to him coolly. Sir James 
    indicates off, whispering hoarsely: 
    
    TITLE:
     
     	"The man sitting facing us 
    	is _Roger Balfour_!"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Burke looks at him searchingly for a moment, 
    then off toward the house. Sir James follows his gaze, 
    fascinated.
     
    131 
    INT. UPPER ROOM  (NIGHT)  CLOSEUP
    The Stranger, as he grows more tense, listening now as 
    though he were certain he heard something.
    
    132 
    EXT. UPPER BRANCHES  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Sir James and Burke.  Sir James is in such a state of 
    nervous excitement now that when he pantomimes: "Let's get 
    down out of here." Burke nods assent. Sir James starts down. 
    Burke turns and looks off again toward the house. Then 
    starts down after him.
     
    133
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Under the tree, as Sir James lets himself to the ground, 
    Burke following. Sir James starts immediately for the gate. 
    Burke stops a moment, then follows.
     
    134
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    At gate, as Sir James waits nervously looking off toward the 
    house. Burke comes softly in:
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"That was Lucy's father. He 
    	shot himself in that house 
    	five years ago!"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Burke frowns, shaking his head slowly, still 
    the doubter, as though it couldn't be. Sir James, in a 
    terrible state of mind, insists: 
    
    TITLE:
     
     	"Did you see the bullet 
    	hole in his temple?"
    
    135 
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    Sir James as he finishes title, a fever amounting almost to 
    a mania, in his eyes.
    
    136
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    Burke profoundly thoughtful says, "Yes," then--

    	baffled."
     
    				CUT FROM TITLE TO:
     
    137
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Both, as Burke finishes title, Sir James urges him in 
    whispered pantomime to come away from the accursed place. 
    Burke looks off toward the house, then says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"There is nothing we can do 
    	but take every precaution -- 
    	and wait."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: They start out.
    
    138 
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  LONG SHOT
    The two men go out over the sideline. As soon as they have 
    gone, the figure of the Stranger who was identified as 
    Lucy's father, appears at an upstairs window. The long shot 
    is weird, ghostly. The Stranger opens the broken window, 
    peering out into the night.
     
    139
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    At window as the Stranger opens the window, peering out. He 
    calls softly:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Lucy....Lucy!" 
    
    BACK TO SCENE: He finishes title, looking out as if he 
    expected to see her.

    BACK TO SCENE: He sits down beside her as though to watch 
    over her should she fall asleep.
     
     				FADE OUT.

    142 
    FADE IN
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE  LONG SHOT  DAY
    The old house, for the first time in the light of day. 
    There is no sign of life about it; and somehow with its 
    ruined garden and its broken windows, it is even more 
    desolate than at night.
     
    				LAP DISSOLVE INTO:
    
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE   FULL SHOT
    Downstairs room. Sir James and Burke are coming down the 
    stairs, slowly looking about them. They reach the foot of 
    the stairs and stop.
     
    				LAP DISSOLVE INTO:
     
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  CLOSE SHOT 
    Burke and Sir James, as Burke says to him: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"Empty, every room -- empty."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Sir James looks off around the great room. 
    His gaze lifts toward the ceiling. He gives a start as he 
    sees:
     
    INSERT:
     
     	Five bats huddled together, 
    	clinging to the ceiling, asleep.
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Sir James points. Burke looks. Then the two 
    men look at each other. Then Burke says quickly:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"I know what you're thinking -- 
    	don't say it." 
    
    BACK TO SCENE: Burke looks off around the room, 
    speculatively. Then he turns to Sir James and says:
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"This is the room in which Roger 
    	Balfour committed suicide?" 
    
    BACK TO SCENE: Sir James tells him that it is. Burke asks:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Where was the body found?"
     
    			CUT FROM TITLE TO:
     
    143
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE   SEMI FULL SHOT
    Burke finishes question. Sir James steps over to a table, 
    turns a chair a little to put it into the position in which 
    the body was found, then indicates a position on the floor,
    as though the body has slouched out from the chair to the 
    floor. Burke comes over to him.
    
    144 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE   CLOSE SHOT
    Sir James as Burke comes into him. Burke looks down at the 
    table, the chair, studying. Then he looks up and says:
    
    TITLE:
     
     	"I want you to tell me all 
    	you know about the circumstances."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Sir James nods willingly. He says: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"I came to see Roger Balfour earlier 
    	in that evening. It was about 8:30. 
    	I came in that door--"
     
    				CUT FROM TITLE TO
     
    145
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  SEMI FULL SHOT
    Sir James, finishing title, crosses and indicates a side 
    door. He goes on telling the story of his visit, Burke 
    listening intently. Sir James crosses to the table, Burke 
    following.
     
    146 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  CLOSE SHOT
    At table, as Sir James indicates a chair at the end of the 
    table, saying: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"Miss Lucy was here when I 
    	called. She was about 
    	thirteen -- hair down her 
    	back, a beautiful child--"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Sir James sighs a little at the recollection.
     
    147 
    EXT. HAMLIN GARDEN (DAY) LONG SHOT
    Lucy and Hibbs coming into the garden. They go over to a 
    pretty spot in the garden and Lucy sits down. Hibbs stands 
    looking at her.
     
    148 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  SEMI FULL SHOT

    at his watch and they exit.
    
    149 
    EXT. HAMLIN GARDEN  CLOSE SHOT
    Hibbs and Lucy as he looks at her long and fondly, then

     				CUT FROM TITLE TO:
     
    153 
    EXT. GARDEN  CLOSE SHOT
    Both, as Hibbs finishes title. Her trust and her faith in 
    him are in her eyes as she looks up at him. She says: 
    
    TITLE:
     
     	"You'll make your way, too, 
    	Jerry--"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: She pauses, then rises and he takes her 
    hands in his. They stand, look into each others eyes. 
    Finally, she says:
     
    TITLE: 
    
    	"You see, Jerry, I love you."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: He gathers her into his arms.
    
    154 
    EXT. HAMLIN GATE  MED. SHOT
    Burke and Sir James turning in at the gate, slowly, 
    thoughtfully.
     
    155 EXT. GARDEN  CLOSE SHOT 
    Lucy and Hibbs, in each other's arms, as they draw apart 
    and Hibbs says: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"I'll tell Sir James--"
    
    BACK TO SCENE: She protests: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"No, no, not yet, Jerry --
    	he has been so good and kind --

    156 
    EXT. GARDEN   MED. SHOT

    Burke and Sir James as Burke indicates off and says: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"Secretaries and servants 
    	sometimes talk too much--" 
    
    BACK TO SCENE: Sir James frowns, looking curiously at Burke, 
    as though wondering if by any chance Burke suspects Hibbs, 
    the secretary. Burke says: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"Better dictate a letter to 
    	Scotland Yard, asking them 
    	to send four men for 
    	tonight."

    "Mr. Hibbs."
    
    159 
    EXT. GARDEN  CLOSE SHOT
    Hibbs and Lucy as they turn. Hibbs hearing himself called, 
    turns to Lucy. Quickly, she makes a signal of silence to 
    him, getting over that he is not to tell Sir James. He nods 
    agreement and exits. She looks off after him fondly.
     
    160 
    EXT. GARDEN  MED.SHOT
    Burke and Sir James, as Hibbs comes into them, Sir James 
    gets over that he wants some work done and Hibbs and Sir 
    James exit to the house. Burke looks off a moment toward 
    Lucy, then exits toward her.
     
    161 
    EXT. GARDEN   MED. SHOT
    Lucy looking off expectantly. After a moment, Burke enters, 
    hat in hand. He stands for a moment, gravely looking at her. 
    Then he says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Miss Balfour, you don't know 
    	me....but whatever happens 
    	I want you to have complete

    164 
    EXT. GARDEN  CLOSE UP
    Burke, as he studies her for a moment with grave eyes, then 
    says:

    	Balfour, cast in ways not 
    	always pleasant--"

    INT. MUSIC ROOM   MED. SHOT
    Sir James dictating a letter to Hibbs, who is sitting a 
    little distance from a window, his steno book on his knee. 
    Sir James pauses. Hibbs slides his chair over so that he 
    can see out of the window. He looks out and sees:
     
    167 
    EXT. GARDEN   SEMI LONG SHOT
    Burke, talking earnestly to Lucy, as she listens deeply 
    engrossed in what he is saying.
     
    168 
    INT. MUSIC ROOM  CLOSE UP
    Hibbs, looking out of the window. He frowns. What can this 
    stranger be talking about to her?
    
    169 
    INT. MUSIC ROOM   CLOSE UP
    Sir James. He turns, says something, then speaks sharply to Hibbs.
     
    170 
    INT. MUSIC ROOM   MED. SHOT
    Sir James and Hibbs, as Hibbs, recalled to himself, turns 
    suddenly and starts again to take Sir James' dictation.
     
    171 
    EXT. GARDEN  CLOSE SHOT
    Burke and Lucy, as he stops talking and they look into each 
    other's eyes. Then she says: 
    
    TITLE:
     
     	"I do trust you -- in 
    	anything!"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: He bows his head a little. Then, with girlish 
    impulsiveness, she tells him: 
    
    TITLE:
     
    	"I think you're wonderful!"

    174 
    INT. MUSIC ROOM  MEDIUM SHOT

    Burke and Lucy, as Lucy nods to some things he is telling 
    her, then turns and runs out of scene toward the house.
     
    176 
    EXT. GARDEN  CLOSE UP
    Burke, looking off after her. Fondly he puts his hand to 
    his cheek where she had kissed him and we have a feeling 
    that if his life were to be lived over again he would have 
    romance in it -- romance with a girl not unlike Miss Lucy 
    Balfour.
     
    177 
    INT. MUSIC ROOM  MEDIUM SHOT
    Sir James, finishing letter, dismisses Hibbs, who exits to 
    the hall.

    INT. LOWER HALL  MEDIUM SHOT
    Hibbs, coming out of music room, meets Lucy, coming in the

    the guest, wanting to know what she means.
     
    179 
    INT. LOWER HALL  CLOSE UP
    Hibbs and Lucy, as he angrily demands of her an explanation. 
    She is much perturbed. She says finally:

     	"I can't tell you -- please 
    	don't ask me--"
     
    				CUT FROM TITLE TO:

    				CUT FROM TITLE TO:
     
    183 
    INT. LOWER HALL  MEDIUM SHOT
    Lucy and Hibbs, as she finishes title. He can only stare at 
    her for a moment. "Are you?" he says breathlessly. 
    Everything must be all right if that is what she is going to 
    do. "Yes," she tells him, and turns and goes into the music 
    room. He stands staring after her, then goes down the hall 
    a little way.
     
    184
    INT. MUSIC ROOM  SEMI FULL SHOT
    Sir James is pacing the floor, deep in thought, as Lucy 
    comes in. She is about to say something to him, but he 
    stops her, then indicates a settee. We have the feeling 
    that he is going to tell her about her father and doesn't 
    quite know how to go about it. He turns, finally, and sits 
    down beside her.
     
    185 
    INT. MUSIC ROOM  NIGHT  CLOSE SHOT
    Lucy and Sir James, on settee, as he sits down. A tremulous 
    excitement is upon Lucy now that the moment has come for her 
    to tell him of her love for Hibbs. Now the problem of how to 
    begin has become her problem. Sir James sits, deeply 
    thoughtful, staring at the floor. She turns to him and is 
    about to tell him in a rush when he looks up and says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Lucy, there is something I 
    	have to tell you--"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: He pauses. She looks at him, big-eyed, 
    inquiringly. He clears his throat and goes on:

     	"I love you, Lucy -- I 
    	want you to marry me."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: He finishes title, taking her hands gently. 
    Lucy, looking at him aghast, at the devotion in his eyes, 
    knows that this is no time to tell him. So she falters:
     
    TITLE:
     
     	"I--I must have time--
    	to--to think it over--"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: He nods gravely, patting her hand gently. 
    She starts to draw away, to rise.
     
    190 
    INT. MUSIC ROOM  MED. SHOT  NIGHT
    Lucy, rising, stands for a moment, uncertainly. Sir James 
    rises, turns toward her. Suddenly Lucy bursts into a sob 
    and runs from the room. Sir James takes a step after her 
    and stops, thinking.
     
    191 
    INT. LOWER HALL  MED. SHOT
    Hibbs is waiting in the hall as Lucy comes out. Burke is 
    coming in the front door. Hibbs glares at him as Lucy, 
    sobbing a little, goes to Hibbs. Burke turns in at the 
    library. Hibbs and Lucy go out to the veranda.
     
    192 
    INT. LIBRARY  FULL SHOT
    Burke, coming in, stands for a moment, then steps over to 
    the desk and picks up one of the volumes on vampires. With 
    this in his hand, he goes over to a chair by the window, 
    where the sunlight is coming in and sits down.
     
    193 
    EXT. VERANDA  CLOSE SHOT
    Lucy and Hibbs, as she tells him what happened. Hibbs gets

    no you can't."
     
    194 
    INT. LIBRARY  CLOSE SHOT
    Burke, turning and looking out of the window. Then, with a 
    little sigh for his advancing age and his incapacity for 
    romance, he takes out his glasses, puts them on and starts 
    to read from the book. After a moment, he glances up from 
    the book into the room.
     
    195 
    INT. LIBRARY  MED. SHOT
    Sir James has come into the library. Burke, looking up, 
    tells him he has been reading something about protective 
    measures. He shows a passage in the book to Sir James:

    	Page in Old English:
     
    	A wreath of tube-roses at the

    Burke, Sir James, Hibbs and Lucy. Hibbs is reading from one 
    of the ancient books at a table. Lucy is placing a wreath 
    of tube-roses at the window. There is a sword on the table. 
    Lucy turns and tells them: "That's done," coming down to 
    the table. Hibbs, picking up the sword and the book, rises.

     	"You didn't like each other
    	very much did you?"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Hibbs is about to resent this question, but 
    there is a force in Burke's direct gaze that he cannot 
    resist. So, after a moment, he answers:

    	"He objected to my caring for Lucy. 
    	He thought I wasn't good enough

    shaft of moonlight, asleep. He stirs a little, turns over,
    into the shadow. A dim figure back to the camera, tips in, 
    leaning over the bed. Burke turns back again into the light. 
    The figure withdraws. Burke sits up, suddenly staring off 
    scene, whips up a pistol from the bed and fires out of 
    scene. (Burke wears pajama jacket. Otherwise, he is 
    completely dressed.)
     
    210

    pistol in hand, stops, looking around. The door to Sir 
    James' room is suddenly thrown open and Sir James rushes

    quickly down to him.
     
    213 
    INT. UPPER HALL  CLOSE SHOT  NIGHT
    Sir James, as Burke comes in. Sir James demanding "What 
    happened?" Sir James is in a bathrobe, which he now ties 
    around him, as though he had been suddenly awakened and had 
    slipped it on very hurriedly before rushing out. Burke 
    tells him about something that came into the room, where he 
    was sleeping. Sir James is aghast. Burke to calm him, says:

    	"Probably my imagination, 
    	Sir James. Go back to bed."

    217 
    INT. HIBBS' ROOM  (NIGHT)  FULL SHOT
    Burke, coming in from hall, switches on the light. It is 
    now seen that he has Hibbs in a hypnotic trance, lying 
    covered by a blanket on a couch in a corner. Burke goes 
    over, looks at Hibbs a moment, then straightens out the bed 
    that he had himself occupied, takes off his pajama jacket 
    and put on his coat. Then he steps over, speaks to Hibbs. 
    Hibbs rises and goes over to the bed and sits on it, just 
    as he was sitting before the last fade out. Burke sits 
    down beside him.
     
    218 
    INT. HIBBS' ROOM  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Burke and Hibbs are on the bed as Burke looks at him with 
    piercing eyes. Hibbs is staring straight ahead of him. Now 
    Burke speaks to him sharply. Hibbs starts, and a 
    transformation takes place. He comes out of the hypnotic 
    trance, realizes his surroundings, looks at Burke and says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"I must have fallen asleep."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Burke nods "yes" and then gets over to him 
    that he'd better be getting to bed. Saying this Burke rises.
     
    219 
    INT. HIBBS' ROOM  (NIGHT)  SEMI FULL SHOT
    Burke, rising, says good night and goes out the door. Hibbs,

    to a dresser.
     
    220 
    INT. HIBBS' ROOM  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    Hibbs at the dresser. He stands there for a moment thinking. 
    He stifles a yawn. Then he looks at his wristwatch.
     
    INSERT:
     
    	CU wristwatch   Time: 2:30
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Hibbs is puzzled. He must have slept hours. 
    That's queer. He stands thinking a moment, then dismisses 
    the problem with a shrug and reaches into a drawer of the 
    dresser and gets out a photograph. He looks at it.
     
    INSERT:
     
    	Photograph of Lucy.
     
    BACK TO SCENE: Hibbs looks at the picture fondly, greatly 
    troubled. He decides to see if she is all right. He turns,

    door to Lucy's room.
     
    223 
    INT. UPPER HALL  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    At Lucy's door, as Hibbs comes in. The sword has gone from 
    its place over the keyhole where Hibbs himself placed it. 
    This he notices now with a start of alarm. He looks down to 
    see if it has fallen. No sword. In genuine anxiety now, he 
    knocks on the door and calls:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Lucy!"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: He waits. No answer. He knocks harder. He 
    calls again, more loudly. Frantic, he tries the door, 
    banging it, calling to her in a loud voice. He throws his 
    shoulder against the door. It gives a little.
     
    224 
    INT. UPPER HALL  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT

    Sitting with his back to the camera is the Man in the 
    Beaver Hat. Lucy, in a white thin negligee, is being led

    if in a prayer, and says:

    234 
    INT. LUCY'S ROOM  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT
    The three men, Burke, Sir James, Hibbs. Burke is at the 
    open window, looking out, as though for something he might 
    be expecting. Hibbs is talking wildly to Sir James. He 
    cries out:
    
    TITLE:
    
    	"They're vampyrs, I tell you, 
    	and I'm going to destroy them -- 
    	the way the book says--"
     
    BACK TO SCENE: He finishes title and turns and runs madly 
    out of the scene, for the time being a maniac. Burke turns 
    quickly down from the window to Sir James, indicates off 
    and says:

    astonishment. Burke replies quickly, his manner brisk and 
    business like.
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"The Scotland Yard men you 
    	wrote for."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: He finishes title. Sir James' relief is

    	The one certain method, which never 
    	fails, is to drive a hickory stake 
    	through the heart of the vampyr.
    
    BACK TO SCENE: Hibbs looks up, looks wildly around the room, 
    as though there might be a hickory stake there somewhere, 
    then turns and runs out the door.
     
    238 
    INT. LOWER HALL HAMLIN HOUSE  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT 
    Burke, opening the door, admitting four burly Scotland Yard 
    men. With Sir James, they all exit to the library.
     
    239 
    INT. SERVANTS QUARTERS  (NIGHT)  SEMI FULL SHOT
    Miss Smithson and the other servants are huddled together, 
    scared half to death. They turn and scream as the door is 
    flung open and Hibbs, wild-eyed and breathless, bursts into 
    the room. Seeing who it is they subside. He tells them that 
    he has got to have an ax and a hickory stake. One of the 
    men hands him a hand-ax from the wood box by the stove. He 
    looks at a chair -- it isn't hickory. Wildly, he turns to 
    the table, inspecting it. With the ax he starts to knock 
    one of the legs off the table.
     
    240 
    INT. LIBRARY  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT
    Sir James sitting at the desk, the four Scotland Yard men 
    and Burke standing, as Burke is crisply telling them of the 
    extraordinary events. They listen like good soldiers, but

    surprise.
     
    241 
    INT. SERVANTS QUARTERS  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT
    Hibbs, finishing sharpening the end of a table leg to a

    and nervously fixes the latch.
     
    242 
    INT. SERVANTS HALL  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    Miss Smithson nervously fixing the latch. Her hand shakes 
    so that she has to make two or three attempts before she 
    gets it. Then she turns, sinks back against the door, 
    breathing deeply, her eyes bulging. Her whole attitude 
    conveys that she thinks she had a narrow escape while the 
    door was open.
     
    243 
    INT. LIBRARY  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT
    Burke turns from the four Scotland Yard men to Sir James at

    BACK TO SCENE: For answer, Sir James reaches into a drawer 
    of the desk and takes out a large Army revolver. Burke 
    looks at it and puts it aside, saying:

    	you can be sure will shoot."

    the four Scotland Yard men. One of them takes an automatic 
    pistol from his pocket and hands it to Burke. Burke gives 
    this to Sir James and tells him to put it in his pocket. 
    Sir James does so. Burke starts to sit down again.
     
    246 
    INT. LIBRARY  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    Burke and Sir James, as Burke sits down, facing Sir James. 
    Burke starts to talk to him and as he talks his eyes take 
    on an intense piercing quality. He stops talking, holding 
    Sir James' gaze with his own for a few feet while neither 
    man moves a muscle. Then Burke turns easily away, leaning 
    back for a moment, relaxed.
     
    James continues to sit without moving. Burke then reaches 
    over and picks up a desk clock. He turns the hands back and 
    sets it down on the desk again. Sir James looks at it.
     
    INSERT:

    247 
    INT. LIBRARY  (NIGHT)  SEMI FULL SHOT
    Burke, rising, pays no further attention to Sir James, who 
    sits staring at the clock. With a gesture to the men to

    267 
    INT. LOWER HALL HAMLIN HOUSE  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT
    The butler is waiting with Sir James' hat and stick, very 
    evidently by arrangement with Burke. Sir James, coming out 
    from the library, takes his hat and stick from the butler, 
    saying:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"I am going over to call 
    	upon my old friend Roger 
    	Balfour."

    looking up toward the windows.
     
    270 
    INT. UPPER ROOM OF HOUSE   (NIGHT)  MED.SHOT
    Man with Beaver Hat, back to camera, Burke comes in. The 
    Man with the Beaver Hat turns and is now seen to be a 
    different person from the man that rented the house. 
    Without a word he whips off the Inverness coat and hat and 
    hands them to Burke. Burke starts to make himself up as the 
    other character -- The Man in the Beaver Hat, as we first 
    saw him face to face, when he rented the house.
     
    271 
    EXT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT
    Hibbs, climbing up a side of the house to look in through a 
    window. He sees:

    Lucy and the Bat Girl alone in the great room. The Bat Girl 
    is starting to undo Lucy's dress at the neck.
     
    273
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    Hibbs, looking in through the broken window. To him, this 
    can mean only one thing -- the girl in black is a vampyr 
    -- she is going to put those sharp teeth in Lucy's 
    throat -- ! With the stake, he smashes at the window.
     
    274 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Lucy and the Bat Girl, as they wheel, staring off toward 
    the window.

    Hibbs plunging in through the window.
     
    276 INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  SEMI FULL SHOT
    The Great Room, as the Bat Girl quickly rushes Lucy off 
    behind some portieres. As Hibbs rushes in that direction, 
    the three men of the Balfour House entourage leap out from 
    places of hiding and seize him. They have ropes and a gag.
     
    277
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Hibbs, struggling in the grip of the three men. Hibbs is a 
    maniac and the struggle is brief but fierce. They wrench 
    the stake and ax from him, hurling them to one side. They 
    start to bind him.
     
    278
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Lucy and the Bat Girl behind portieres. The Bat Girl is 
    holding her, telling her not to interfere. But Lucy must 
    see. She pulls the portiere aside a little, looking out. 
    
    279
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT
    The three men and Hibbs. They have him on the floor, 
    binding him tight, putting a gag in his mouth.
     
    280
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT) CLOSE SHOT
    Lucy and the Bat Girl, behind the portieres. Lucy turns 
    back, hiding her face with her hands. The Bat Girl, her 
    manner business-like, starts again to undo Lucy's dress 
    from the shoulder.
    
    281 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  FULL SHOT
    Of the Great Room, as the three men carry Hibbs out of the 
    room. As they exit, at the top of the stairs appears the 
    Man in the Beaver Hat. He starts slowly down the stairs.
     
    282
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    With traveling camera, of the Man in the Beaver Hat as he 
    comes slowly, with awful purpose in his eyes, down the 
    steps. He stops at the landing, his eyes searching the 
    room.
     
    283 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT
    Door or portiered exit through which Hibbs was taken by 
    the three men. The three now reappear. They stop, looking 
    off toward the stairs.
     
    284
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    The Man in the Beaver Hat, staring out of scene at them 
    with piercing eyes. He gives an order.
     
    285 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  SEMI FULL SHOT
    There is sudden activity on the part of the three men. The 
    Stranger moves over to the table, fixing the chairs there 
    in exactly the right position, then sitting down. (The 
    bullet wound does not appear on his temple now, though we 
    make no point of its not being there.) Another of the three 
    men slips on a butler's coat and takes up a position by the 
    side door. The third man withdraws. The Man in the Beaver 
    Hat, who has been watching this from the landing of the 
    stairs, now comes down and views the setting, suggesting a 
    change or two, perhaps here and there.
     
    286 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    Behind portieres, as the Bat Girl finishes hooking up a 
    simple little dress (the sort that would be worn by a girl 
    of thirteen or so) on Lucy. Lucy's hair is now down, as a 
    child would wear it.
     
    287
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  SEMI FULL SHOT
    Everything appears to be to the satisfaction of the Man in 
    the Beaver Hat now. He steps over to the portiere.
     
    288 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    At portieres, as the Man in the Beaver Hat speaks softly. 
    Lucy appears through the portieres, looking now like a girl 
    of thirteen, in her child's dress with her hair down. She 
    looks at the Man in the Beaver Hat, unafraid. Gravely he 
    nods. That is the way he wants her to appear. They start 
    out from scene.
     
    289 
    EXT. BALFOUR GATE  (NIGHT)  MEDIUM SHOT
    Sir James, coming in, turns at the gate, and without even 
    looking up at the house or without faltering in the 
    slightest, starts toward the veranda and side door.
     
    290 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT) SEMI FULL SHOT
    The Man in the Beaver Hat is coming down from the portieres 
    with Lucy. He places her at an end of the table and gives 
    her a book to look at.
     
    291 EXT BALFOUR VERANDA  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT
    Sir James coming with unhesitating steps along the veranda, 
    works the knocker on the door.
     
    292 INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  SEMI FULL SHOT
    All inside hear the knocker and turn. With a gesture, The 
    Man in the Beaver Hat waves all out of the room except the 
    Stranger and Lucy at the table and the man in the butler's 
    coat. Then he (the Man in the Beaver Hat) ducks quickly 
    behind the portieres. The butler goes to the door.
     
    293 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    At door, as the butler opens it and Sir James steps in, he 
    hands his hat and stick to the butler with a grave nod and 
    exits into the room.
     
    294 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  MEDIUM SHOT
    The Stranger and Lucy at the table. The Stranger says: 
    "Good evening, James" Lucy gets up and comes to Sir James 
    in f.g. He turns and puts his arm around her saying:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"My! My! What a big girl 
    	you're getting to be, Lucy."

    hair, looking down at her fondly.
     
    296
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    At portieres, as they part slightly and the Man in the 
    Beaver Hat peers out with piercing eyes.
     
    297 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  MED. SHOT
    Sir James, the Stranger and Lucy, as Sir James holds Lucy 
    off at arm's length, looking at her, at the sweet girlhood 
    of her. The Stranger watches them morosely. Sir James turns 
    to him says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"You seem despondent, Roger."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: The Stranger nods. Lucy steps quickly, 
    impetuously over to him, putting an arm around him.
     
    298
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    Lucy and the Stranger, as she puts her arm over him, 
    lovingly, kissing him on the forehead. He pats her hand, 
    tells her it's nothing.
     
    299
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE   (NIGHT)   CLOSE UP
    Sir James, watching them, his eyes narrowing as he looks,

    The three of them as the Stranger finishes title. Lucy 
    gives him a good night kiss, then steps over to Sir James, 
    holding up her lips to him. Sir James kisses her and she 
    runs out of scene. Sir James stands looking off after her. 
    The Stranger watches him sullenly. Sir James turns back now 
    to the Stranger, drawing up the chair, and sitting down at 
    the table, facing him.
      
    302
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    The Man in the Beaver Hat peering through the portieres. He 
    parts them a little more, bringing his whole face into view 
    -- the face with the pallor of death, as expressionless as a 
    mask.
    
    303
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    Sir James and the Stranger at the table. Sir James leans 
    over and says:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"You may as well understand, 
    	Roger, that as soon as she 
    	comes of age, I mean to 
    	have her."
     
    BACK TO SCENE: The Stranger pounds his fist on the table 
    and says: "No, by God!" They look straight into each 
    other's eyes for a moment, then the Stranger says:
     
    TITLE: 
    
    	"I trusted you, James Hamlin, 
    	and you've stolen from me 
    	right and left."
     
    				CUT FROM TITLE TO:
     
    304 INT. BALFOUR HOUSE   (NIGHT)   MED. SHOT
    The two men, as the Stranger, finishing the title, starts 
    to rise. Before he can do so, Sir James has leaped to his 
    feet and drawn his pistol. They rush into a clinch, a 
    struggle.

    310 
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE SHOT
    The Man in the Beaver Hat and Sir James, as the man speaks 
    to him sharply. Sir James goes quickly through the 
    transformation of coming out of a hypnotic trance. He 
    stares at the Man in the Beaver Hat, saying dazedly:
     
    TITLE:
     
    	"Have I been asleep?"

    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
    The Man in the Beaver Hat, as he finishes title, and

    that of Burke, the detective.
     
    315
    INT. BALFOUR HOUSE  (NIGHT)  CLOSE UP
