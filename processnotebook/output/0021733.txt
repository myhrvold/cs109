_DISOLVE TO INTERIOR INSPECTOR HAYLEY'S OFFICE as Duff enters, removing his
dripping hat and ulster._

**DUFF: Morning, Hayley.   
  
HAYLEY: Morning, Duff. Happy to see you. I'm in need of a bit of cheer.

  
DUFF: I brought some with me. Just had a letter from our old Chinese friend,
Charlie Chan.

  
HAYLEY:** _(Pleased)** **_**Where is he? Still in Honolulu?

  
DUFF: Yes. He's Inspector of detectives there, now. And he sends a photograph
of what he calls his multitudinous blessings.** _(Handing photograph to
Hayley)** **_**Says he's named his youngest child after me -- Duff Chan.**

_CLOSE SHOT -- INSERT -- Charlie Chan at the right. Mrs. Chan at the left, and
between them ten children, ranging from a boy of eighteen to a baby of two --
the three youngest in Chinese dress. All wear happy smiles.

  
_

![Chan family photo.](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript02.jpg)

**

HAYLEY: Great Scott! Looks like something out the 'Birth of a Nation,' doesn't
it?

  

**

_Duff turns photo over. In bold hand-writing is the inscription: "Each man
thinks his own cuckoos better than next man's nightingales. Charles Chan"_

**DUFF: Pity he's wasted in a place like Honolulu, isn't it?   
  
HAYLEY: Can't be any worse than here. Wish something would happen - I need
action!

  
DUFF: Don't hunt trouble; it's bad luck. Remember what Chan used to say about
that, don't you?

  
HAYLEY:** _(Grins)** **_**What?

  
DUFF:** _(Quotes -- smilingly)** **_**"Always very hard winter when honorable
cheese runs after mouse."**

_Duff restores photograph to his pocket, picks up coat as if to go. Telephone
rings -- Hayley answers.

  
_

**HAYLEY:** _(Into phone)** **_**Yes? Inspector Duff is here now.** _(Motioning to Duff)   
  
_**DUFF:** _(Takes phone) _**Yes -- Duff speaking...what?...Party of American
tourists on a trip around the world? What about it?....Murdered? What's his
name?...Where was he murdered?......I'll come at once!** _(He hangs up --
addresses Hayley) _**Wealthy American named Hugh Morris Drake, murdered at
Broome's Hotel. Better come along.**

_DISOLVE TO: CLOSE SHOT of tightly clenched fist. A pair of hands force
fingers open, taking from them a piece of platinum chain to which is attached
safe-deposit box key.

  
ON SOUND TRACK throughout action is heard the distracted sobbing of a girl.

  
CAMERA MOVES BACK, disclosing Duff in Room 28, Broome's Hotel - the hand and
arm of a murdered man, and girl kneeling at foot of bed, head bowed in arms,
body convulsed with sobs.

  
Hayley gently lifts the girl to her feet.

_

**

HAYLEY: Please, Miss, you'd better go -- this is Inspector Duff from Scotland
Yard.

  

**

_The girl, unresisting, still sobbing, covers face with hands, as they lead
her gently away. Almost at door she stops and speaks._

**PAM: **_(Brokenly) _**He was so good -- so kind to everyone -- how could anyone do it? **

_They lead her to the door._

**DUFF: I should like to speak to you later, Miss.   
  
PAM: Very well.** _(Exits)

  
_**HAYLEY: That's his grand-daughter. She was making the trip around the world
with him.**

_Duff examines key._

**DUFF: Number 3260. Dietrich Safe and Lock Company, Canton, Ohio.** _(Softly) _**Good old boy. Tried to help us. Tore off the end of his assailant's watch-chain, and kept it for us.   
  
HAYLEY:** _(Nods)** **_**That's something.**

_Again Duff bends over bed -- Hayley watches. He turns, holding, with a
handkerchief, a thin, black leather strap._

**DUFF: Strangled with this.**

_Hayley nods.

  
CAMERA FOLLOWS DUFF as he moves to dresser near alcove.

  
From dresser, Duff, still using handkerchief, picks up a pair of earphones,
examines them carefully, puts them back.

_

**DUFF:** _(To himself) _**Deaf.**

_Through open window, from street below, come the notes of "Silver Threads
Among The Gold," Duff turns from dresser, moves to window, looks out, then
examines lock carefully -- closes window, then opens it again.

  
He turns from window to a door connecting room 28 and 29. With his
handkerchief, he tests knob. It is locked. He stands a moment, puzzled, then
turns to Hayley, who enters to him, holding a small chamois bag in his hands.

_

**HAYLEY:** _(Giving him bag)** **_**Found this at the head of the bed.**

_Duff takes the bag, opens it -- pours part of the contents into his hand. It
is filled with small round pebbles, which Duff examines closely._

**DUFF: Pebbles.   
  
HAYLEY: What do you make of it, Chief?

  
DUFF:** _(Recapitulating as he pours pebbles back into bag) _**A harmless old
man -- very deaf, strangled to death -- yet no evidence of any struggle.**
_(As though thinking aloud) _**Not even the nap of the carpet has been
disturbed.** _(Gazing thoughtfully about him)_** I believe he wasn't murdered
in this room.**

_Kent, Manager of Hotel, and Dr. Lofton, enter from hall._

**KENT: Pardon me, inspector, Doctor Lofton, conductor of the tour.** _(Presenting Dr. Lofton)_ **This is Inspector Duff of Scotland Yard.   
  
LOFTON: I'm not precisely a _conductor_. For fifteen years, I have been
managing director of Lofton's round-the-world tours.

  
DUFF:** _(Dryly) _**Yes?

  
LOFTON: This year I have a comparatively small group -- thirteen; at least,
there were thirteen last night.

  
DUFF:** _(Noding) _**Ah, yes. Was there any trouble on the tour before last
night? Anything that seemed like enmity?

  
LOFTON:** _(Indignantly) _**Absurd! The members of the party scarcely know one
another as yet.**

_Duff eyes him. He continues excitedly._

**Don't begin with the idea that some member of the party killed Hugh Drake! It's impossible -- some sneak thief -- some hotel servant --   
  
DUFF: Why do you wish me to think that?

  
LOFTON:** _(Almost pleading as he lays his hand on Duff's arm) _**Inspector,
this is a serious situation to me -- my reputation -- everything is liable to
be ruined by this --

  
DUFF: **_(Holding out thin black strap with which Drake was murdered) _**I
understand. Have you ever noted this strap on the luggage of any of your
guests?**

_He stops at the surprised look on Lofton's face._

**LOFTON: This is odd! I have a strap identically like that on one of my bags.   
  
DUFF: Will you get it, please?

  
LOFTON: Gladly, Inspector.

  
DUFF: Have you assembled the members of your party in the drawing room?

  
LOFTON: Some of them are out, but I've gotten most of them together.

  
DUFF: Thank you, Dr. Lofton.

**

_Lofton exits.

  
Duff turns to Kent.

_

**Who occupies the room next to this?** _(Pointing to door between rooms)   
  
_**KENT: A Mr. Honywood, sir. Member of this party.

  
DUFF: Can you open it?

  
KENT: Yes.**

_He turns to door and with pass-key unlocks it. He stands aside as Duff goes
into Honywood's room.

  
CAMERA FOLLOWS WITH DUFF. Room 29 is much smaller than room 28. There is a
sense of mustiness about it, the windows being tightly closed.

  
Duff goes to window, tries to open it, but cannot.

  
He takes out notebook -- glances around room -- makes memorandum. He notices
half-packed Gladstone bag. As he bends over it --

  
SOUND OF KEY BEING INSERTED IN LOCK.

  
Walter Honywood enters room - a dissipated looking man in late thirties.

_

**DUFF: Come in, Mr. Honywood.**

_An expression of alarm appears on Honywood's face, at seeing Duff in his
room._

**Sit down, please. You know what's happened, of course?**

_Honywood nods._

**You heard no cry -- no struggle during the night?   
  
HONYWOOD:** _(Nervously) _**Nothing -- I was sound asleep when the murder was
committed.

  
DUFF:** _(With lightning rapidity)** **_**Oh, you know when it occurred, then?

  
HONYWOOD: Well -- no. Of course not. I merely assume I must have been
asleep.** _(Mopping his brow)

  
_**DUFF:** _(Watching him with deep interest)** **_**I seem to have heard your
name somewhere.

  
HONYWOOD: I'm a theatrical manager. Perhaps you've also heard of my wife, Miss
Sybil Conway?

  
DUFF:** _(Nods)** **_**She's with you?

  
HONYWOOD: No. We had an estrangement about two months ago. She's at San Remo
on the Riviera. Our tour touches there, and I hope to persuade her to join
me.**

_Honywood takes out cigarette and holds lighter to it. His hand trembles
violently, he looks up -- sees Duff watching him._

**This affair has been a great shock. You see, I recently had a nervous breakdown.   
  
DUFF:** _(Ironically) _**Rather odd, isn't it, Mr. Honywood, that a man who
has just had a nervous breakdown should be such a -- sound sleeper?

  
HONYWOOD:** _(Starts) _**Why -- I -- I never have any trouble that way.

  
DUFF: Will you wait for me below, please?**

_Honywood makes an effort to pull himself together, and exits. Duff re-enters
room 28, where finger-print expert and Hayley are still working._

**

Any finger prints?

  
HAYLEY: Not yet.

**

_Duff starts from room. At door the excited Lofton almost bumps into him._

**LOFTON:** _(Entering excitedly)** **_**My strap is gone!   
  
DUFF: Really?** _(Pointing to the strap on a small table near the door)
_**Then perhaps this is yours?

  
LOFTON:** _(Looking closely -- then frightened)** **_**I'm afraid it is --

  
DUFF:** _(Noting Lofton's aggitation) _**Well go into this matter of the
strap, later. Will you wait downstairs, please?**

_Lofton exits._

**KENT:** _(Entering with an old man) _**This is our night watchman. He wishes to make a statement.   
  
EBEN: It's this way, sir. While I was making my rounds last night at two
o'clock, I saw a gentleman standing in front of room 27. When he heard me he
said, "I'm afraid Im on the wrong floor. My room is below."

  
DUFF: You saw his face?

  
EBEN: Yes, sir. I can identify him if hes still about. Then, at four o'clock,
on the upper floor, someone in the dark knocked me down.

  
DUFF: The same man?

  
EBEN: Can't say, sir. As I fell my torch showed a gray suit. I seized the
pocket of the coat and heard the cloth tear. Then he hit me again -- and when
I come to, he was gone.

  
DUFF:** _(Knits brow)** **_**Thank you, Eben. Wait downstairs. **_(To Hayley)
_**Look for a gray coat with a torn pocket -- or the other end of this chain.

  
HAYLEY:** _(As Duff is about to go) _**This may interest you; did you know
there's a retired Chicago racketeer in this party?

  
DUFF: Really?

  
HAYLEY: Yes -- man named Max Minchin -- the New York police have asked us to
keep a kindly eye on him.

  
DUFF: Thank you, Hayley -- we shall.**

_CUT TO:

  
THE LOUNGE

  
Members of the party are assembled, including Max and Sadie Minchin.

  
The lounge is done in red plush and walnut decorations. There are book-cases
of dusty volumes -- old sporting prints. Outside, the sun has pierced through
the fog, and is casting weird light into the room, illuminating the faces of
the Lofton party. Max Minchin, who has made himself the center of interest in
group, addresses them.

_

**

MAX: The first thing to remember if anybody here done it, don't say nothin'
until you seen a lawyer.

  
SADIE: Come on, Maxie, it's no use nursing a grouch, nobody's accusin' you.

**

!["...nobody's accusin' you."
](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscriptmaxandsadieminchin.jpg)

**

MAX: Patrol your own beat, I'm takin' no info from a skirt!

  
MRS. LUCE: What language is he speaking?

**

_CUT TO:

  
LOBBY OF BROOME'S HOTEL

  
Dr. Lofton has joined Duff. As they move down lobby in direction of lounge, a
dignified man enters from one of he side corridors. He is distinguished in
appearance -- has a shock of snow-white hair. Lofton stops him as he passes.

_

**LOFTON: Mr. Tait! Inspector Duff of Scotland Yard.** _(To Duff)_** Mr. Tait is a criminal lawyer from New York. **

****&nbsp_place_holder;

**TAIT:** _(Holding out hand) _**How do you do, sir. What is this about murder?   
  
DUFF: Step inside, Mr. Tait. You will know all the details in a moment.**

_Tait turns with Duff and with a firm step crosses the threshold of the
lounge. He stands a moment, looking about at group inside, then gives little
strangled cry and pitches forward onto floor. Duff is beside him in an
instant, turns him over with deep concern -- looks at his face. It is as blank
as that of the dead man upstairs. _

__&nbsp_place_holder;

_Immediately a young man enters and kneels down beside Tait. He is good-
looking, with frank eyes - but his manner is somewhat startled. Removing a
small, pearl-like object from a bottle, he crushes it in handkerchief and
holds it under Tait's nose.

_

!["Amyl nitrate. It will bring him around..."](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderp
ictures/.pond/carscriptamylnitrate.jpg.w300h228.jpg)

**MARK KENNAWAY:** _(To Duff)** **_**Amyl nitrate. It will bring him around in a moment.   
  
DUFF: You are Mr. Tait's travelling companion?

  
MARK: Yes. I'm Mark Kennaway. Mr. Tait is subject to this sort of thing.
That's why he employed me to come with him.**

_Tait stirs; starts breathing heavily as he comes to. Duff indicates that they
had better get him out of there. Together they carry him into a little coffee
room leading from lobby, and place him on a couch._

**DUFF:** _(To Mark)_ **Let me know when he's fully recovered.**

_He starts from room as Martin comes in. Duff stops him. Martin is a servant
with a rather blank face - much younger than Eben. He is obviously nervous._

**DUFF: Are you Martin?   
  
MARTIN: Yes, sir.

  
DUFF: You discovered Mr. Drake's body this morning?

  
MARTIN: Yes, sir.

  
DUFF: Tell me about it.

  
MARTIN:** _(Nervous - stumbling in speech)** **_**I awoke Mr. Drake every
morning, sir. He was very deaf and it took a bit of doing.

  
DUFF: And this morning?

  
MARTIN: I knocked many times, but there was no answer.

  
DUFF: What then?

  
MARTIN: I got the housekeeper's key, and entered the room. Then I notified the
management at once, and that's all I can tell you, Inspector.

  
DUFF: Thank you, Martin.

  
MARTIN: Yes, sir.

**

_Duff starts from the coffee room and gets into lounge. He closes door behind
him - walks to center of room, addresses those awaiting him._

**DUFF: Allow me to introduce myself. Inspector Duff of Scotland Yard.**

_The various members of the group look at him with anxious eyes. Duff turns to
CAPTAIN RONALD KEANE, a man of about 38, with a hawk-like nose, well-dressed,
and seemingly at ease. At Duff's look of inquiry, he introduces himself._

**KEANE: I am Captain Ronald Keane.   
  
DUFF: Military man?

  
KEANE: Why - yes.

  
MRS. LUCE: Captain Keane told me that he was in the British Army and has seen
service in India and South Africa.

  
DUFF:** _(To Keane) _**Is that true?

  
KEANE:** _(Hesitates)** **_**Well -- no -- not precisely. I was just - well -
romancing a bit. You see -

  
DUFF:** _(Interrupting) _**Were you ever in any army?

  
KEANE:** _(Again hesitating - afraid to tell another lie)** **_**Well - no --
the title is really honorary.

  
DUFF:** _(Makes a note, coming very close to him) _**Just what is your
business?

  
KEANE: None, at present -- retired --

  
DUFF: What were you?

  
KEANE: Well, once I was an engineer -- just put me down as -- as -- gentleman.

  
DUFF: Been out of the hotel this morning?

  
KEANE: Yes, to cash a check.

**

_Duff turns to Mrs. Luce._

**DUFF: And you?**

_Retired lady. She smiles widely and glances at Keane. Duff, getting the
shaft, smiles._

**DUFF: Just travelling?   
  
MRS. LUCE: My fourth trip around he world.

  
DUFF:** _(Looking at list) _**You occupy Room 27, Madam?**

_Mrs. Luce nods._

**You heard no sounds last night in the room where --   
  
MRS. LUCE: Not last night - but - there was a row the night before.

**

_Duff looks at her with interest. Mrs. Luce hesitates a moment, looking at Dr.
Lofton._

**Perhaps Dr. Lofton would like to tell you, himself.**

_Lofton rises, very ill at ease, as Duff turns to him._

**DUFF: Just what occurred the night before last, Dr. Lofton?   
  
LOFTON:** _(A bit panicky)** **_**I was in Mr. Drake's room. He objected to
several members of the party. Their presence upset him. I was merely trying to
explain my position.**

_Duff gives him a long look and makes note. He turns, looks in direction of
small alcove. As Duff nods, a tall man in tweed suit, rises. He carries a
heavy walking stick, and one leg is held rather stiffly as he limps toward
Duff._

**DUFF: Your name, sir,   
  
ROSS: John Ross. I am a lumberman from Tacoma, Washington.

  
DUFF: Know anything about this murder?

  
ROSS: Not a thing, Inspector.

  
DUFF: You knew Drake, of course?

  
ROSS: Yes. Nice old fellow - got to know him pretty well on board ship. I
liked him a lot.

  
DUFF: Been out this morning?

  
ROSS: Yes. I went for a walk.

  
DUFF: That will be all.

_Duff makes a memorandum in book as Ross returns to alcove.

  
Mark Kennaway enters from coffee room.

_

**MARK: Pardon me, Inspector. Mr. Tait has recovered.**

_Duff nods and turns to occupants of room._

**DUFF: You will kindly wait here a moment.**

_CAMERA FOLLOWS WITH DUFF - as he enters coffee room.

  
Patrick Tait is sitting erect on couch, a glass of spirits in his hand, which
Martin, the waiter, has just served him. As Martin passes Duff, he stops him.

_

**DUFF: Ask Eben, the night watchman, to step in the lounge. I'll be there in a moment.   
  
MARTIN:** _(Mutters)** **_**Yes, sir.** _(Exits quickly)_

_Duff's eyes follow him for a moment, then he turns to Tait._

**DUFF: Feeling better, Mr. Tait?   
  
TAIT:** _(Apologetically) _**Yes -- a bit too much excitement, I fear. But I
still don't know who was murdered!

  
DUFF: Hugh Morris Drake! You occupy number thirty, near his room. What time
did you retire?**

_Tait looks at Mark._

**MARK: It was about twelve, Inspector. You see, I read to Mr. Tait every night before he goes to sleep.   
  
DUFF: Mr. Tait, what was it you saw in the lounge that brought on this attack?

  
TAIT:** _(Becoming very excited - eyes glazing) _**The attacks come like that.

  
DUFF: Did you see someone in the lounge?

  
TAIT: **_(Rising -- almost screaming)** **_**No -- NO!**

_He suddenly catches his left side. Mark steps forward quickly._

**MARK: Inspector - please. This man is ill.   
  
DUFF: I'm sorry. I apologize.

**

_Tait bows acknowledgement._

**Nevertheless, Mr. Tait - I intend to find out what it was that shocked a retired criminal lawyer into a heart attack.**

_Duff turns from him and re-enters the lounge.

  
CAMERA MOVES WITH DUFF - to where Eben, the old night watchman has been
studying the faces of the men in the room. First, Lofton, then Ross, then --
suddenly he points. Duff has been watching him closely.

_

**EBEN: **_(Firmly)** **_**That's the man.**

_He is pointing at Keane, who sits up._

**KEANE: What do you mean?   
  
EBEN: I mean it's you I met on my two o'clock round, last night.

  
DUFF: Is it true?

  
KEANE:** _(Looking rather anxiously about him)** **_**Why, yes. I was up
there. You see, I couldn't sleep and wished to borrow a book from Mr. Tait.

  
DUFF: It's pretty old - that wanting-to-read-a-book stuff. Why did you say
you'd mistaken the number of your room?

  
KEANE:** _(Fumbling about)** **_**Why, I just said the first thing that came
into my head.

  
DUFF: Rather a habit with you, isn't it?**

_Duff makes memorandum in his book - then dismisses Eben. Suddenly he wheels
on Honywood._

**Just one thing more, Mr. Honywood.**

_Honywood starts violently as Duff approaches him. Duff holds out small
chamois bag filled with pebbles. He pours a few into his hand for Honywood's
inspection._

**Do these mean anything to you?   
  
HONYWOOD: **_(Shaking his head) _**I never saw them before in my life.**

_Duff returns bag and pebbles to pocket. Honywood stops to pick up cigarette
he has dropped on carpet.

  
Duff turns to the Minchins, his eyes lighting with interest.

_

**DUFF: You are -** _(Looking at list)** **_**-- Mr. Minchin?   
  
MAX: What about it?

  
SADIE:** _(Angrily)** **_**Max! Nobody's accusin' you! Answer the man's
questions!

  
MAX: What for? He's a dick, ain't he? I should help him!

  
DUFF: One moment, please, Mr. Minchin. Allow me to warn you -

  
MAX:** _(Interrupts) _**I know - that everything I say will be used against
me. I heard that one before.

  
SADIE: Max!

  
MAX: All right.** _(To Duff)** **_**What do you want to know?

  
DUFF: Where are you from?

  
MAX: We're from Chicago -- and never mind the funny cracks about the daily
casualty lists.

  
DUFF: Casualty lists? I don't understand -

  
MAX: That's what they call the newspapers out there --

  
DUFF: I'll not annoy you with more questions, Mr. Minchin. We're already
supplied with considerable information about you.**

_Elmer Benbow, short, stout -- Germanic ancestry, enters, followed by Mrs.
Benbow. He carries a small motion picture camera. Going to Duff he takes his
hand -- shakes it enthusiastically._

**BENBOW: Pleased to meet you, Inspector. This will be something to talk about when we get back to Akron. Mixed up in a murder -- Scotland Yard, and all that! Meet the missus!   
  
DUFF:** _(A trifle coldly) _**How do you do?

  
BENBOW: Just been out trying to get some moving pictures. Anything we can do
to help you, Inspector?

  
DUFF: Do you know anything about this murder?

  
BENBOW: If you mean -- did we do it -- we certainly didn't. Mr. Drake was an
automobile manufacturer and I make tires. Can you imagine a tire manufacturer
killing off one of his best customers?

  
DUFF: **_(Smiling) _**Hardly.** _(He shows Benbow platinum chain and key)_**
Ever seen this before?

  
BENBOW: No. But it was made in Canton, Ohio.** _(Turning to wife) _**That's
funny, isnt it?

  
DUFF: What is? Have you seen any member of this party carrying anything like
it?

  
BENBOW: No. I just thought it was strange that it was made so near to our
home.

  
DUFF: Ah, yes. **_(To others)_ **That will be all for the present, thank you.
None of you must leave London without permission of the Yard.**

_Duff stands at door as the group passes him. He watches them closely. Keane,
with his sly face; Honywood, with an assumed nonchalance; Ross, with his frank
manner and slight limp; Max Minchin, with his sullen slouch, followed by his
be-jeweled wife; smiling Benbow and his mate; then Patrick Tait, now walking
with a firm step.

  
While Duff watches them speculatively, Pamela Potter enters. She still shows
evidence of grief, but is calm now, and wears an air of angry determination.

_

**PAM: Is it true, Mr. Duff - that you think the crime was committed by some member of this party?   
  
DUFF: I regret to say that I do.

  
PAM: In that case, I shall cable my mother and my aunt to come to London, and
I shall continue with the tour.

  
DUFF: Do you think that is advisable?

  
PAM: Please don't try to dissuade me, Mr. Duff. I want to help find out who
did this cowardly thing.

  
DUFF: And we, for our part, may need your assistance.

  
PAM: I might discover some clew - one of them might let something slip.

  
DUFF: Quite probable, indeed. I have a Chinese friend who used to say: "Only a
very sly man can shoot off a cannon quietly."

**

_Mark enters. He comes to Pam, stands for a moment before her - slowly offers
his hand._

**MARK: I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how very sorry I am, Miss Potter. If there is anything I may do to help you, please ask me.   
  
PAM: **_(Who has taken his hand) _**Thank you, Mr. Kennaway.**

!["Thank you, Mr.
Kennaway."](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscriptpamelaandmark.jpg)

_They leave together -- Duff joins Hayley and finger print man in lobby._

**

HAYLEY: Not a trace of the chain or the gray coat.

  
DUFF: I thought as much - every one of them had been out of the hotel before
we got here.

**

_Duff and the two men move to the entrance of hotel. At door, Duff gives some
instructions to Kent, the hotel manager. Kent signifies he understands.

  
CUT TO UPPER HALLWAY

  
Martin, the waiter, looks fearfully over his shoulder, takes two pieces of
paper from his pocket, and tucks them under carpet on the floor.

  
CUTBACK TO STREET

  
As Duff reaches it, coming out of hotel. Benbow is standing on sidewalk.

_

**BENBOW: Say, listen, Inspector -- just turn around and face me, will you? **

_Duff turns, sees Benbow smiling, with his motion picture camera leveled and
ready for action._

**DUFF_: _**_(Annoyed) _**Oh, say -- if you don't mind --   
  
BENBOW: Mind? I'm delighted. Just take off the benny, will you -- the lid, you
know -- the hat. This light isn't very good.

  
DUFF: But you don't understand -- it isn't customary, you know --

  
BENBOW: Just let me shoot this -- the neighbors back in Akron'll eat it up --
"Inspector from Scotland Yard leaving hotel after murder" -- this'll be a wow!

  
DUFF: If you don't mind, I'd rather not.**

_Duff turns abruptly to enter his little green police car._

**BENBOW: **_(Laughing genially and calling after him -- turning crank) _**That's all right; I'll just ontitle this one: "Scotland Yard Inspector refusing to be shot!"**

_FADE OUT.

  
FADE IN

  
INTERIOR HAYLEY'S OFFICE SCOTLAND YARD

  
Duff, puffing furiously at his pipe, paces about room. Hayley is seated.

_

**

HAYLEY: Too bad we weren't able to hold them. This looks like the end of the
case -- just another unsolved murder.

  
DUFF: But we couldn't hold them. The American Ambassador himself asked me --
Where is our proof? -- What was the motive?

  
HAYLEY: Yes -- and tonight they're in Paris, then Nice -- San Remo -- Egypt
--Singapore -- Honolulu-- around the world.

  
DUFF: And the murderer traveling with them -- unknown.

**

_Sergeant Burke enters. There is a cheerful excited air about him._

**BURKE: I think we've got something, Chief. The man says he's ready to talk.   
  
DUFF: Bring him in.

**

_Burke, in the open door, motions to someone without. Martin, the waiter from
Broome's Hotel, enters, very frightened. Duff points to a chair._

**Sit there, please.**

_Martin does so. Duff, rising, stands over him._

**Where did you get all that money you've been spending? Don't tell me you were playing the races! Come on, the truth!**

_He jerks Martin to his feet._

**MARTIN: You won't send me to prison, sir?   
  
DUFF: I'm giving you one chance; where did you get that hundred pounds?

  
MARTIN: Mr. Honywood gave it to me.

  
DUFF: What for?

  
MARTIN: I'll tell you everything, sir. At ten o'clock that night I went
upstairs with a cablegram for Mr. Drake. I knocked at his door --

  
DUFF: Then what?

  
MARTIN: Mr. Honywood opened it.

  
DUFF: Honywood in Drake's room?

  
MARTIN: Yes, sir. I gave him the envelope. He said: "You'll find Mr. Drake in
my room. We have changed rooms for the night."

**

_Duff gives Hayley a quick glance of exaltation, then to Martin:_

**DUFF: What then?   
  
MARTIN: I knocked on the door of Mr. Honywood's room. Mr. Drake came to the
door, took the cablegram and thanked me.

  
DUFF: And the hundred pounds?

  
MARTIN: At seven o'clock the next morning, Mr. Honywood sent for me, handed me
two fifty-pound notes and made me promise not to say anything about the
exchange of rooms.

  
DUFF: **_(Turning to Hayley and pounding his fist in his hand)_ **What did I
tell you? Drake wasn't murdered in his own room. I was right!

  
HAYLEY: Honywood!

  
DUFF: **_(His spirits soaring) _**We have him, my boy! **_(Looking at his
watch)_** I've just time to catch the night boat to Dieppe.

  
HAYLEY: The party is leaving Paris for Nice, tonight.

  
DUFF: And the Riviera Express will get me there a day later.

  
HAYLEY**: _(Grasps Duff's hand -- shakes it heartily)_ **Good luck and
congratulations!

  
DUFF: **_(Starting from room)_ **Thanks, old chap.**

_DISSOLVE TO:

  
LOBBY of lounge of Hotel Excelsior Grande in Nice. Sun shines through windows
overlooking terrace garden and Mediterranean.

  
Pam is holding animated conversation with bearded gendarme, resplendent in
gold lace uniform. Dr. Lofton is with them.

_

**GENDARME: You noticed nothing in his manner except nervousness?   
  
PAM: Nothing. On the contrary, he seemed in good spirits.

  
GENDARME: But Mademoiselle --

  
LOFTON: I scarcely expected you so soon!

  
DUFF: Expected me?

  
LOFTON: Walter Honywood killed himself in the grounds of this hotel last
night.

**

_Mrs. Luce has joined the group, and overheard Lofton's last remark._

**MRS. LUCE: Suicide, your grandmother! Inspector Duff, -- you're needed here! This is another murder!   
  
DUFF: Murder?

  
MRS. LUCE: Absolutely. Mr. Honywood expected something to happen -- he tried
to leave a letter with me. I suggested that Dr. Lofton was the proper person
to give it to, but he insisted that Dr. Lofton was decidedly not the proper
person.

  
LOFTON**: _(Hastily)_ **I telephoned Mrs. Honywood at San Remo -- when she
heard the news I believe she fainted.**

_Duff turns to the gendarme -- draws him aside from group._

**DUFF: If you like, I'll take charge of this -- there was another murder in London, and I believe the two are connected.**

_CAMERA FOLLOWS AS THEY MOVE DOWN LOBBY

  
They pass a group in which are Tait, Mark, Ross and the Benbows. They all
appear apprehensive as Duff passes them. As the two men near telephone booth,
Duff pauses.

_

**I'll report any progress.**

_Gendarme bows, exits. Duff enters booth. As he does so, Sadie and Max Minchin
pass booth._

**MAX**: _(Looking towards Duff in booth)_ **Hm! 'Nother guy put on the spot and the place is swarming with bulls.   
  
SADIE: Uh - huh.

  
MAX: Gee -- don't it make you homesick?

  
SADIE: Uh - huh.**

_CUT TO:

  
INSIDE TELEPHONE BOOTH

_

**DUFF: It was not suicide, Mrs. Honywood, your husband was murdered.....What! _You_&nbsp_place_holder;know who murdered him? He's with the party?....but his name -- his name...What name is he using now?....You don't know.... **_(Wiggles receiver up and down)_ **Are you still there?.....Very well, I'll be at your hotel at six this evening with the Lofton party.....Thank you.**

_He hangs up. As he comes out of booth he almost collides with Lofton._

**DUFF: Doctor, you may leave for San Remo at 4:30 as you had planned. The party will not be detained here.**

_Lofton gives him a curious look as Duff walks away.

  
DISSOLVE TO:

  
PALACE HOTEL, SAN REMO

  
Sitting room of Sybil Conway.

  
She is a beautiful woman, attractively gowned.

_

**DUFF: You say the man who killed Honywood is named Jim Everhard?   
  
SYBIL: Yes.

  
DUFF: Why did he kill him?

  
SYBIL: I was married to Jim Everhard, but we were unhappy. Then I met Walter
Honywood -- and we ran away -- Everhard swore he would kill us both.

  
DUFF: **_(Takes out chamois bag with pebbles)_ **Ever see these before?

  
SYBIL: No -- but I know what they mean. When we ran away, I took two bags of
diamonds with us, but they weren't Everhard's -- he had stolen them, too.

  
DUFF: All this in South Africa?

  
SYBIL: Yes.

  
DUFF: Are you sure, Mrs. Honywood, that you will be able to recognize Jim
Everhard when you see him?

  
SYBIL: Positive.

  
DUFF: Very well. There are some palms just out side the dining room door --
you will have a clear view of the Lofton party. All you need to do is point
him out to me. Ready?

  
SYBIL: Yes.**

_They move from the room to hall, which is in semi-darkness. They step to the
elevator and enter. It is a narrow cage-like contraption. Duff presses button
-- slowly they begin to descend._

![Slowly they begin to
descend.](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript08.jpg)

_Suddenly there is a sharp explosion above their heads -- Duff gets the
fleeting impression of a blurred form above, leaning over shaft. The woman at
his side collapses. He is just in time to catch her in his arms. A small
object hurtles through the air and lands at his feet. Duff tries to stop the
car but cannot until it stops automatically at first floor. As he pulls the
gates open,_

_CUT TO:

  
DARKENED HALLWAY -- FOURTH FLOOR

  
Mark Kennaway is rapping at door of a room.

_

**MARK: Mr. Tait! Mr. Tait! -- Are you there?**

_Keane glides up to him._

**KEANE: What's happened?   
  
MARK: Mr. Tait was here a moment ago. **_(Catches himself)_ **I was just
wondering where he is.**

_CUT BACK TO:

  
FIRST FLOOR

  
Duff places Sybil Conway on a sofa -- opposite elevator. Pam and one or two
other guests hide the body from view of the camera.

_

**PAM: **_(To Duff)_ **Shall I call a doctor?   
  
DUFF: Too late. The woman is dead.**

_FADE OUT.

  
FADE IN

  
PLATFORM OF STATION AT SAN REMO

_

**DUFF: You won't forget to write the letters you promised me?   
  
PAM: Certainly not. Will you join us again, Inspector?

  
DUFF: Probably. Im going to America. **_(Smiles)_ **Meanwhile, if anything
important comes up, cable me at Scotland Yard.

  
PAM: **_(Eagerly)_ **Oh, I know something will -- I feel sure we have only to
wait --

  
DUFF: Waiting won't do, we've got to work. As my Chinese friend expresses it:
"Sitting man must hold mouth open very long time before roast goose flies
in."**

_Pam laughs and extends her hand._

**PAM: Goodbye, Inspector.   
  
DUFF: Miss Potter, take care of yourself.

**

_Guard blows his whistle and compartment doors are banged shut.

  
Duff assists Pam into her compartment and closes door after her. Train starts
to pull out. Duff stands on platform watching members of party as they look
out of windows of their compartments. One by one they&nbsp_place_holder;pass
him -- Mark as he leans forward, talking to Pam, Benbow, as he stands at
window with motion&nbsp_place_holder;picture camera grinding final shot, Ross
with Malacca stick, head of which he taps against his lips and chin; Captain
Keane, with his sly, fox-like expression; Max Minchin and bejeweled wife, Max
waving him farewell with a knowing wink; Lofton, pulling at beard nervously;
and the last face -- Patrick Tait -- worried, old before his time -- white as
death.

_

_As Duff watches the last of party disappear, a puzzled expression comes over
his features. In his hand he is holding thin platinum chain and key.

  
As he twirls around finger --

_Mark Kennaway, holding sunshade over Mrs. Luce, poses in front of a shop with
Mr. Benbow taking motion&nbsp_place_holder;pictures. Mrs. Benbow, smiling,
stands beside him._

**BENBOW: **_(Stops cranking)_ **There -- that'll be enough, I guess.   
  
MRS. LUCE: Thank you, Mr. Benbow.**

_Benbow and wife turn to new scenes. Mrs. Luce smiles at Mark._

**Thank you, Mr. Kennaway, very sweet of you to devote yourself to an old lady like me, but if I were a young man --   
  
MARK: If you're going to talk about Miss Potter again, please don't. The
subject irritates me.

  
MRS. LUCE: **_(Looking at him with interest)_ **Oh I'm sorry -- you were
together so much until the last few days, I thought--

  
MARK: **_(Irritably)_ **So does everyone else, but it isn't so.

  
MRS. LUCE: **_(Pretending surprise)_ **What isn't.

  
MARK: One can't be nice to a rich girl without everyone's thinking --

  
MRS. LUCE: What she thinks is all that matters, isn't it?

  
MARK: Probably she thinks so, too. She's deliberately avoiding me. It's a bit
of a curse to be born as rich as she is. **_(Starts with surprise -- hands her
sunshade)_ **Will you excuse me, please?

  
MRS. LUCE: **_(Sees Pam coming)_ **Oh! I thought you said she was avoiding
you.

  
MARK: It's sort of a mutual agreement.**

_He walks away and enters a jewelry shop._

**MRS. LUCE: **_(Waiting for Pam) _**I was just talking about you with a very charming young man who doesn't quite know what's the matter with him.   
  
PAM: **_(Somberly)_ **He knows very well what's the matter with him, and he's
proud of it.

  
MRS. LUCE: My dear! All those beautiful moonlight nights together and then --
this? What has occurred?

  
PAM: I was born in the wrong town. In the eyes of superior persons from
Boston, I'm insufferably mid-western, and then, of course, there's my
misfortune.

  
MRS. LUCE: What do you mean?

  
PAM: It's a sort of disgrace to be the grandchild of a man who had brains
enough to make a lot of money. Didn't you know?

  
MRS. LUCE: **_(Smiling)_ **Has it ever occurred to you, my dear -- that it may
be embarrassing for a self-respecting young man to court a wealthy girl?

  
PAM: **_(As if the idea were quite new to her, pauses, searches Mrs. Luce's
eyes)_ **Do you really suppose that's what's the matter with that aristocratic
iceberg?**

****&nbsp_place_holder;

**MRS. LUCE: I'm positive.** _(As Pam starts away)_ **Where are you going?  
  
****PAM:** _(Happily)_ **Perhaps I can fix this little matter.**

_She goes to the shop Mark has entered, but near the door stops and saunters
casually in apparently unaware of his presence. Near the door she meets Max
and Sadie Minchin engaged in an argument.

  
Sadie, carrying a paste-board box about the size of a bushel basket, faces
with angry glare, the equally angry Max.

_

**SADIE: **_(Defiantly)_ **Well, anyway, I wanted it and I got it, and I'm goin' to keep it, so what?   
  
MAX: Sure, buy a lot of junk you don't even know what to do with. And how are
you going to carry that thing all around the world?

  
PAM: **_(Anxious to conciliate)_ **What did you get, Mrs. Minchin?

  
SADIE: **_(Pleased with herself)_ **A reading lamp.

  
MAX: **_(In utter disgust)_ **Yeah -- a readin' lamp. Next thing you know,
she'll be wantin' to buy a book to go with it.**

_He walks angrily out of the shop._

**SADIE: **_(Calling after him)_ **No. We won't either have to buy a book to go with it - 'cause I&nbsp_place_holder;_got_ a book!**

_She angrily marches out after him._

**PAM: **_(Pretending surprise at seeing Mark)_ **Oh, Mr. Kennaway -   
  
MARK: I'm sorry.

  
PAM: **_(Pretending amazement) _**What about?

  
MARK: **_(Embarrassed)_ **I thought - perhaps - my presence might annoy you.

  
PAM: We're going to miss this old war when it's over, aren't we?

  
MARK: You won't mind -- you'll be having one with someone else. I can't
imagine you without a war.

  
PAM: **_(Smiling)_ **Am I really so awful? What would a girl from Beacon
Street, Boston, do in a case like this?

  
MARK: **_(Angrily)_ **I wish you'd leave Beacon Street out of it -- it's
ceased to be funny.

  
PAM: All right; let's declare an armistice. If you'll forget mid-western
barbarians - I'll forget Beacon Street.

  
MARK: **_(Forced to smile)_ **Will you keep the truce?

  
PAM: Of course! On this party we're forced to meet each other. Let's disguise
our true feelings and pretend to be friends. **_(Impulsively offering her
hand)_ **Is that agreed?

  
MARK: **_(Takes hand - smiles) _**Agreed!**

_At this moment, Chinese proprietor of shop approaches with tray of jewelry.
Pam is immediately interested, and selects a beautiful string of jade._

**PAM: How much is this?   
  
CHINAMAN: Two hundred and eighty dollars.

  
**

_Pam holds it up for Mark's inspection.

  
_

**PAM: Beautiful, isn't it?   
  
**

_Mark nods, turns away -- it is too rich for his pocket. Pam picks up another
piece of jewelry. As she does so, another Chinaman enters scene. Suddenly he
breaks into an excited string of Chinese; points in direction of street,
concludes his speech with the English words: JIM EVERHARD. Pam starts and
looks in direction of street.

  
FROM HER ANGLE we see five members of Lofton party as they move past shop. In
the group are Keane, Lofton, Tait, Ross and Benbow. Pam turns to Mark
excitedly.

  
  
_

**PAM: Jim Everhard! The name of the man who killed my grandfather! **_(To Chinaman)_ **Which one is Jim Everhard?**

_The Chinaman shrugs; indicates he doesn't understand. Pam rushes to door,
followed by Mark. The party has moved about twenty yards away.

  
_

**PAM: **_(Excitedly)_ **That's the man Inspector Duff wants - who was he looking at? Which one did he mean?   
  
MARK: I'm sorry I couldn't tell.**

_Pam turns back to door of the shop to question the Chinaman, but he has
disappeared.

  
She hurries after the group. Mark follows. When she reaches a point about ten
yards from them, she calls sharply:

_

**PAM: Jim Everhard!**

_She waits to see who turns at the name. All five men do. Her trick has
failed. But she tries to carry it through - looking from one to the other, she
says:

  
_

**The Chinaman in that shop pointed out Jim Everhard - I was hoping to catch him before all of you, but I know him - **_(She turns quickly to Mark)_ **Come on -**

_They walk away, leaving the five men staring at one another.

Mark and Pam hurrying down the street.

  
_

**MARK: I'm sorry you did that - you don't realize what you've done.   
  
PAM: What?

  
MARK: You've put yourself in danger. Jim Everhard is in that group - he thinks
you know him, but you don't. We don't know whom to watch - and you're liable
to be next.

  
PAM: **_(As the deadly possibility dawns upon her)_ **Where's the telegraph
office? I'm going to cable Inspector Duff.**

_As they start off -

  
DISSOLVE TO

  
INTERIOR CABLE OFFICE NEARBY -

  
Pam takes cable blank, stands at a high desk directly in front of a stand
lamp, and starts to write a cable.

  
Mark stands beside her. As he glances around, he sees a gloved hand holding a
pistol around the jamb of the side door, the barrel aimed straight at Pam.

  
CUT TO

  
Mark - swiftly seizing Pam and whirling her out of range, just as the weapon
is discharged shattering the lamp, before which Pam was standing.

  
Frightened, Mark holds her a moment, then releases her and runs to the door -
looking up and down the street. He sees no one who might have made the
attempt. He then turns back to her with a blank, worried face.

  
_

**PAM: **_(Faintly) _**Thank you. I guess -- I guess you saved my life.**

_She seems so frightened that Mark runs to her and takes her in his arms
protectingly, as we -

  
FADE OUT.

  
FADE IN

_CHAN'S OFFICE POLICE STATION, HONOLULU.

  
Chan is seated at a table -- before him is Duff's brief case and papers. Duff
is pacing the room, smoking his pipe.

  
_

**DUFF: When Miss Potter's cable reached me, I was on my way to Tacoma. I changed my plans, flew to San Francisco and took the first boat. I'm glad I arrived before anything happened to her.   
  
CHAN: **_(Leans across the table)_ **When she shouted the name Jim Everhard at
Hongkong - no man looked around -- quick?**

![Chan leans across the
table.](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript20a.jpg)

**DUFF: No. She tried to trick him, but failed. What should she have done, Charlie?   
  
CHAN: Too late now. Advice after mistake is like medicine after dead man's
funeral.

  
DUFF: Strange situation, Charlie - that the man who committed that murder has
the nerve to remain with the party.

  
CHAN: Yes. Only very brave mouse makes nest in cat's ear.

  
DUFF: **_(Looks at his watch)_ **This visit will remain a pleasant memory,
Charlie, but the Lofton party sails at ten. Where can I call a taxi?

  
CHAN: **_(Rising)_ **Not to be considered. I will take you. I have brand new,
second-hand 1919 Model Y.

  
DUFF: Model Why?

  
CHAN: Must be -- that's what everyone ask me, -- why. **_(Goes to door of
room)_ **I will get. **_(He exits)_

_Duff bends over the table and returns his papers to brief case. As he does
so, a gloved hand holding a revolver is seen outlined against an open window
overlooking back alley of police station. The gun is aimed directly at Duff,
and is fired. Duff whirls, staggers a step or two in direction of window and
lunges forward to floor. An instant later a small object is thrown through the
window, lands on floor beside Duff's body.

  
_

![...a gloved hand holding a
revolver...](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript21.jpg)

_Chan opens door of office, sees Duff lying on the floor, gives a startled
exclamation - runs forward and bends over him.

  
Duff's face is pale as death. Quickly Chan feels pulse, then reaches up and
presses button on desk. Again he bends over the prostrate figure of his
friend.

  
At Duff's side, Chan's eyes come to rest on a replica of the three little
Chinese monkeys. He picks them up, and as he looks at them, their significance
as a threat dawns upon him. He puts them in his pocket.

_

![...their significance as a threat dawns upon
him.](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript22.jpg)

_The door opens -- a native Hawaiian policeman enters.

_

**CHAN: Telephone for ambulance and surgeon at once, then ask the chief to come here. Quick!**

_Chan looks helplessly about, then his eyes take in the window and the misty
darkness outside. On the table is Duff's open brief case. Some of the papers
are still in the case, others are strewn about carelessly, scattered by the
wind.

  
Chan quickly restores papers to case. As he does so, the Chief enters.

_

**CHIEF: What's this, Charlie?   
  
**

_His eyes light on the prostrate figure of Duff.

  
_

**CHAN: Shot in back from bullet entering from there. **_(Points to open window) _**Poor Inspector Duff. He comes to quiet city of Honolulu in search of murderer. Now this --   
  
CHIEF: Shot down in the Honolulu police station! Impertinence!

  
CHAN: **_(Nodding)_ **Even worse than that -- insult! Shot down in very office
of Inspector of Detectives. **_(Indicating himself)_ **I am laughing stock of
world -- very well, then, I shall sail tonight on 'President Arthur.' **

_Chan starts strapping up Duff's brief case._

**CHIEF: But Charlie -- you can't do that!   
  
CHAN: **_(Interrupting)_ **Please omit argument, otherwise resignation
effective at once. No time to lose. **_(Grabbing phone - giving number)_
**Hello! -- This you, Henry?....honorable father speaking...I sail half-hour
on 'President Arthur'....what?....kindly omit surprised feelings....pack bag
with amazing speed -- tooth-brush, other suit, razor. Bring bag with your
mother to dock. You will understand speed is essential. Thank you so much.
**_(Hangs up receiver)_

!["That you,
Henry?"](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscriptthatyouhenry.jpg)

**

CHIEF: But Charlie, listen! This job is dangerous! The man's a killer!

  
CHAN: If I do not have that man before San Francisco, retire forever in sack-
cloth with ashes.

**

_Chan kneels beside Duff who stirs slightly._

**DUFF: **_(Whispering faintly)_ **Charlie!   
  
CHAN: Tell me, Inspector -- did you see face of assailant?

  
DUFF: **_(Half unconscious) _**Lofton -- Tait -- Keane -- Ross -- Benbow -- **

_There is an expression of increasing amazement on Chan's face, then Duff
continues:_

**Which one is it - Charlie?   
  
**

_He relapses into unconsciousness._

**CHAN: Take best care -- get to hospital -- send me wireless. If he wakes, tell him Charlie Chan carries on.   
  
**

_As Chan starts from office with Duff's brief case under his arm -

  
DISSOLVE TO:

  
Sadie and Max near small fruit stand. The vendor is absent. Max and Sadie are
examining a box of avocados. Sadie's arms are so full of bundles she cannot
use her hands.

_

**SADIE: **_(To Max, who is bending over fruit)_ **Before you buy them, you better pinch them to see if they're soft.   
  
MAX: **_(Looking at her with compassion)_ **To see if they're soft? There's
nobody lookin' -- what about just pinchin' them? **

_Chan notes this conversation. Sadie, suddenly aware of Chan's nearness,
nudges Max and nods toward Chan. Max, who has already picked up one of the
avocados, and is about to take another, looks around at Chan.

  
_

![Sadie, suddenly aware of Chan's
nearness...](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/car15adockscene.jpg)

**MAX: Oh, hello Chink! How's the laundry business?   
  
CHAN: **_(Smiles)_ **Pretty much like yours -- quietly picking up.

  
MAX: **_(To cover)_ **Wonder where the guy is that runs this stand? **

_Max puts avocados back on stand and goes aboard. Chan stands looking after
them.

  
Mrs. Chan and Henry enter to him.

  
The boat is just about to sail; steward beats warning gong.

  
_

**MRS. CHAN: **_(Looking at her husband with timid eyes)_ **Wheh you go now, please?   
  
CHAN: **_(Giving her a kindly pat on back) _**Events explode suddenly like
firecrackers in the face of innocent passerby. Do not worry. **

_She holds up little travelling bag to him._

**MRS. CHAN: Not enough clo'es. You must wait and get big trunk.   
  
CHAN: **_(Shakes head firmly)_ **No. Too late to dig well when honorable house
is on fire. **

_He kisses her in Occidental fashion, then turns to Henry.

  
_**In my absence you will show your mother every deference, and guard family
well. **

**HENRY: Okay. And say, Pop -- can I use your bus 'til you come back?   
  
CHAN: **_(Nodding)_ **Ha! I foresaw this request. But please treat bus with
unusual kindness. **

_The deep whistle of the boat is heard. Chan turns toward gangplank and starts
up. He waves to his family.

  
FADE OUT.

  
FADE IN

  
Chan and the Captain are walking along the deck the same night. The ship is on
its way to San Francisco.

  
_

**CAPTAIN: I have sent word to the party asking them to wait for you in the smoking room. I'm back of you, Charlie, I hope you get your man.   
  
CHAN: You invent picture of very happy event. Thank you so much.

**

_He bows and leaves.

  
CUT TO:

  
INTERIOR SMOKING ROOM

  
The men of the Lofton party are assembled. There is an atmosphere of sullen
resentment.

_

**BENBOW: More questions -- and what good does it do?   
  
MAX: That's all right. Answer them -- only don't tell em nothin'.

  
LOFTON: For my part, I'm sick of questions. Nothing has ever come of them, and
nothing ever will.

  
CHAN: **_(Enters and bows, smilingly)_ **May I extend courteous greeting. You
are surprised to find me here -- I also. Yesterday Inspector Duff come to
Honolulu -- Paradise of Pacific. Tonight, history repeat itself. Serpent
appears in Paradise - Inspector Duff is in hospital, insultingly wounded. And
so, reluctantly, I must force my inspeakable presence upon you. So sorry --
but must ask questions. **

!["May I extend courteous greeting."
](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscriptquestions.jpg)

**TAIT: Allow me, sir -- to point out to you that we are no longer under the jurisdiction of the Honolulu authorities.   
  
CHAN: Of course, if anyone has something to hide --

  
TAIT: I won't allow you to maneuver me into that position. Why do you imagine
I have anything to hide?

  
CHAN: **_(Smiles and shrugs)_ **Man seldom scratches where he does not itch.

  
TAIT: **_**(**Resentfully)_ **I'm simply reminding you that there is such a
thing as proper legal procedure.

  
CHAN: Which is always criminal's best friend. We understand that, you and I,
Mr. Tait -- do we not?

  
LOFTON: I don't blame Mr. Tait; from the very first we've been annoyed by
questions by incompetent police officials.

  
CHAN: **_(Bows)_ **Stupidity humbly acknowledged. But sometimes dull stone
makes very sharp knife.

  
ROSS: Perhaps, Mr. Chan, it would be advisable to postpone the cross-
examination until your suspects are in better humor.

  
CHAN: Possibly you are right. Time does not press and talk will not cook rice.
**

_He dismisses them with a polite gesture.

_

**Thank you - so much.**

_All turn to leave except Minchin._

**MAX: You seen what happened to Inspector Duff, didn't you? You better get yourself some iron underwear -- you know B.V.D's.   
  
CHAN: Oh, I see. B.V.D. - before very dead. Thank you, so much.

**

_He bows pleasantly, and as Chan walks from the smoking room --

  
DISSOLVE TO:

  
Chan, in the interior of his promenade deck cabin, in the act of opening
Inspector Duff's brief case.

  
From the case he takes a small chamois bag and the platinum chain to which is
attached the safe-deposit box key.

  
He places the brief case on top of a dresser directly under the window, and
moves under the light to better examine the chain and key. He places this in
his pocket, then opens the bag and pours the small pebbles from the bag into
the palm of his hand. _

![The hand is reaching for the brief
case.](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript28.jpg)

_Chan looks up suddenly, and in the mirror of his dressing table, he sees the
reflection of the window through which appears a hand -- the same hand that
searched in the trunks in Nice, and placed the revolver in the lifeless hand
of Honywood. The hand is reaching for the brief case. It has the case in its
grasp when suddenly Chan wheels and jumps for the porthole. He is just in time
to wrench the case from the intruder's grasp, and tears the glove from it at
the same time. He throws the case down quickly, then jumps up to the window
and looks out onto the dimly lighted deck. About thirty yards away he sees a
man leaning over the rail. The man's back is toward him, but as he turns his
head, Chan sees it is Dr. Lofton.

  
He studies Lofton a moment, then returns to the light and very carefully
examines the glove.

  
He is startled by a sharp, insistent knock on his door. He goes to it, opens
it, and discovers the frightened Pam.

_

**PAM: Mr. Chan --   
  
CHAN: You're frightened - what has happened? Come in.

**

_Pam enters and closes the door after her. _

**PAM: Some person has been in my stateroom.   
  
CHAN: How do you know?

  
PAM: I was out of it for a moment -- when I came back, this was on my dresser!

**

_She shows him a little cardboard box with a cover over it._

**I thought perhaps Mrs. Luce had given me a present, but she knows nothing about it. That's why I've come to you.**

_Chan takes the box from her, removes the lid and holds up the famous three
Chinese monkeys with their paws respectively over their eyes, ears and mouth._

[!["'See nothing, hear nothing - say nothing.'"](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilde
rpictures/carscript24a.jpg)](http://undefined)

**CHAN: It is a warning - **_(Looking at monkeys) _**'See nothing, hear nothing - say nothing.'**

_(Chan exits)

  
FADE OUT.

  
FADE IN

  
Chan is shown on deck in the morning sunshine.

  
The wireless operator comes to him and hands him a paper.

_

**OPERATOR: Wireless for you, Mr. Chan, from Honolulu.   
  
CHAN: **_(An expression of worry crossing his face)_ **From Honolulu...
**_(Opening envelope and reading with staring eyes -- expression of pleasure
comes over his face)_ **From friend in hospital -- thank you, so much.**

_He turns and hurries along deck where Pam and Mark are playing shuffle-
board._

**PAM: **_(To Mark, teasingly)_ **Well, at least you might&nbsp_place_holder;_pretend _that I don't annoy you. **_**(**She sees Chan)_ **Any news yet, Mr. Chan?   
  
CHAN: Yes. Cable says operation is success. Honorable Duff doing very well.

  
PAM: I'm so glad to hear that! Any developments in the case?

  
CHAN: Not yet -- Patience and a mulberry leaf become a silk shawl. **_(He bows
and exits) _

_DISSOLVE TO:

  
Chan in stateroom, as he searches rapidly in the baggage and bureau drawers.

  
At last, from under the mattress of the berth, he finds a gray glove, mate to
the one he tore from the hand that came through his window on the previous
night. He has just stopped to examine it, when the door is suddenly pushed
open, and Lofton confronts him.

_

**LOFTON: I won't submit to this sort of thing! What are you doing in my cabin?   
  
CHAN: Only trying to seize truth with my fumbling hands. Will you kindly
explain this interesting exhibit?

**

_He holds out glove to Lofton._

**LOFTON: What does that mean?   
  
CHAN: That is what I wish to find out. Is it your glove?

  
LOFTON: No. Are you pretending you found it here?

  
CHAN: Pretending -- no. I did find it here. You have never seen it before?

  
LOFTON: Certainly not. What do you hope to accomplish with this absurd trick?
Do you imagine you can frighten me into confessing something?

  
CHAN: Oh -- have you something you would not wish to confess?

  
LOFTON: No. Don't tell me you suspect&nbsp_place_holder;_me_ of complicity in
this thing! It's absurd -- impossible!

  
CHAN: I am only trying to find the criminal who committed these crimes, and
punish him. **_(He looks keenly at Lofton)_ **He who feeds the chicken,
deserves the egg. **

_He bows._

**Thank you -- so much.**

_As he exits from cabin --

  
DISSOLVE TO:

  
Chan on deck, under the dim deck lights. He stands partly concealed, watching
the door of a stateroom. His figure retreats from view as the door is
stealthily opened. Keane emerges, looks carefully forward and aft on the deck,
then carrying a small bundle, steals quietly towards the rail and near where
Chan is concealed.

  
He is about to throw the bundle overboard, when Chan, with a leap, restrains
him. The effect upon Keane is devastating.

_

![He is about to throw the bundle
overboard...](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript25.jpg)

_Chan unrolls the bundle -- it is a gray coat with the right-hand pocket torn.

_

**KEANE: What do you want?   
  
CHAN: This gray coat - with torn pocket. You should have disposed of this,
long ago.

  
KEANE: What do you mean?

  
CHAN: Watchman in Broome's Hotel, London -- tore right-hand pocket of
murderer's suit.

  
KEANE: I know he did - I heard it at the inquest. That's why I tried to get
rid of this. **_(Eagerly)_ **Please believe me - someone just tore the pocket
of this coat - someone's trying to put suspicion on me. If this were the suit,
I wouldn't have kept it. Do you think I'm a fool?

  
CHAN: **_(Shrugs)_ **Who shall say? Every man must wear out at least one pair
of fool shoes. **

_He smiles blandly and makes a little bow.

  
_

**Thank you so much.**

_The apparently terrified Keane watches Chan with staring eyes as he bows
himself away, carrying the coat.

  
DISSOLVE TO:

  
EXTERIOR TAIT'S CABIN

  
Chan knocks on the door and enters. He finds Mark busy with his tie.

  
On the dressing table is a neat little silver frame, enclosing Pam's
photograph.

_

**MARK: Come in, Mr. Chan. **_(Adjusting tie)_ **I'm just getting ready to go out and give the ladies a treat.**

_Chan's eyes smilingly rest upon the photograph of Pamela._

**CHAN: May I wish luck? Good wife best household furniture.   
  
MARK: If you mean Miss Potter - there isn't a chance. There's something I
wanted to tell you.

  
CHAN: Yes?

**

_Mark opens dresser drawer - takes out two sets of Chinese monkeys, shows them
to Chan._

**

MARK: Miss Pamela told me you found one of these beside Inspector Duff, and
that another was put in her stateroom as a warning.

  
CHAN: Where did Mr. Tait buy these?

**

!["Where did Mr. Tait buy
these?"](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript24.jpg)

**

**MARK: That's what I can't understand. He says he didn't buy them, and has no idea how they got into this room. What do you make of it?   
  
CHAN: Very strange. But wait --**

**

_Chan drops to his knees, and drags from beneath Mark's berth a suitcase on
which is pasted a label from the Great Eastern Hotel in Calcutta. Near the
label are the initials "M.K." He points to label._

**You will regard that, please.   
  
MARK: **_(Moving closer)_ **What about it?

  
CHAN: Please feel with fingers. **

_Mark bends down and rubs his hand over the label. He frowns._

![Mark bends down and rubs his hand over the
label.](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript26.jpg)

**

**MARK: Feels like a key.   
  
CHAN: It is a key - duplicate of one found in hand of murdered man in
London.**

**

_He takes the duplicate key with the platinum chain attached from his pocket,
and shows it to Mark, who stares in surprise._

![...shows it to Mark, who stares in
surprise.](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/car14chanandmark.jpg)

**MARK: Who put that on my bag?**

_He looks around cabin for a moment, then his eyes rest on a pair of pajamas
on the berth occupied by Tait. He continues:_

**Do you think -- can it be possible -- that Mr. Tait -- Why don't you ask him to explain?   
  
CHAN: Not yet. Man should never hurry 'cept when going to catch flea.
**_(Pointing to key)_ **Keep open eye on this -- it will be removed before
ship reaches port. Let me know moment it is gone.

  
MARK: I will, Mr. Chan.

  
CHAN: Thank you so much. **_(He exits)_

_CUT TO:

  
Pam standing near a flight of stairs leading up to the deck above.

  
As Chan emerges from Tait's room, she motions to him urgently. Chan goes to
her.

_

**CHAN: **_(As he approaches her)_ **You have found something?   
  
PAM: I don't know whether it's important or not - have you the little bags of
pebbles?

  
CHAN: **_(Takes bags from pocket)_ **These?

  
PAM: **_(Takes one of them - looks at it carefully)_ **Yes. They're the same.
I was in Mrs. Benbow's cabin today, and she has a bag exactly like them.

  
CHAN: Maybe very important. Are you sure --

  
PAM: I'm positive. Even the same color draw string. She uses it for a jewelry
bag.

  
CHAN: Does she know you saw it?

  
PAM: Yes - that's why I thought I better tell you. When she saw me looking at
it, she picked it up quickly and put it away. Do you think, Mr. Chan, that Mr.
Benbow could be -- **

_Suddenly, Chan looks up, as a slight noise above attracts his attention. Then
swiftly he seizes Pam and whirls her out of the way. As he does so, a long
knife flashes down, and stands quivering in the deck at their feet. _

![...a long knife flashes
down...](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript29.jpg)

_Chan swiftly but guardedly runs up the stairs along the deck to the other
side. He sees a limping man making a hurried escape, a cane held in his left
hand, and tapping sharply on the deck. The man hastily descends stairs to
lower deck.

  
Hurriedly, Chan descends the stairs and runs swiftly around the deck to
intercept the man. At the corner of the companionway, he encounters Ross,
walking leisurely along - smoking a cigar. His attitude and expression cause
Ross to speak.

  
_

**ROSS: **_(Calmly and pleasantly)_ **What's wrong, Mr. Chan?   
  
CHAN: **_(Still showing amazement)_ **I thought -- you were on upper deck a
moment ago.

  
ROSS: No, I just came out of my cabin. Why do you ask?

  
CHAN: **_(A sudden change coming over him - he looks at Ross' cane which he
carries in his right hand)_ **Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Ross. I have made mistake.
I just saw man with cane in wrong hand, and no rubber tip. You wear rubber tip
on your cane, always, not so?

  
ROSS: Yes - always. It's safer for a man of my disability. I always carry it
on the lame side.

  
CHAN: **_(Bows)_ **Of course. Please overlook incident. Someone, I think, is
trying to impersonate you.

  
ROSS: Really? **_(He laughs)_ **Well, someone has been trying to throw
suspicion on all the other members of this party. Apparently it is my turn
now.

  
CHAN: Apparently. Please excuse. Thank you so much. **

_FADE OUT.

  
FADE IN

  
Chan is seated in corner of salon, very downcast in appearance.

  
FOG HORN BLOWS.

_

**MAX: **_(Entering)_ **Hello, Inspector!   
  
CHAN: **_(Listlessly)_ **'Lo.

  
MAX: Running into more fog, huh?

  
CHAN: **_(Uninterested)_ **Yes.

  
MAX: Well, we'll be in San Francisco in a couple of hours. Have you nailed
your man yet?

  
CHAN: Nailed -- no. Guess I'm trying to hunt rabbit with blind dog.

  
MAX: Cheer up, Charlie -- maybe you'll catch him.

  
CHAN: Maybe? **_(Shrugs)_ **Every maybe has a wife called Maybe-Not.

  
MAX: Oh, that reminds me -- My wife and I are throwing a farewell dinner party
tonight to celebrate the end of the tour. Will you join us?

  
CHAN: **_(Listlessly)_ **Thank you so much. **

_Max exits. Chan resumes his gloomy retrospection. Pam enters to him._

**PAM: Well, we're almost there, Mr. Chan.   
  
CHAN: **_(Unhappily)_ **Sorry -- yes.

  
PAM: And nothing yet?

  
CHAN: Suspicion -- yes. Proof -- no. I have no evidence to hold anyone in San
Francisco. Ho-hum, I imagine I am very clever man -- now find slight mistake.
**

_He touches his forehead with his finger as he says lugubriously --_

**Big head is only a good place for very large headache.** _(Turns and smiles at Pam)_** And how is case of irritating young man?   
  
PAM:** _(Smiling)** **_**Well, there's still hope. He's just asked me to meet
him on deck.

  
CHAN:** _(Pleasantly)_ **Ah! Opportunity knocks on door again. What if young
man proposes?

  
PAM:** _(Eagerly)_ **Do you think he will?

  
CHAN: In what way should I know?

  
PAM: I wish he would.

  
CHAN: And then -- what?

  
PAM: I'd refuse, of course - for the sake of my wounded pride.

  
CHAN:** _(Shaking his head)_** Woman's heart is like a needle at bottom of
sea.

  
PAM: Oh, we're not so hard to fathom. In a way, of course, it will be a pity -
he can be so nice when he wants to be.

  
CHAN:** _(Smiling)_ **Can he?

  
PAM: But he seldom wants to be. Shall I see you at Mr. Minchin's dinner?

  
CHAN: I think so.

  
PAM: 'Bye.** _(She exits) _

_Chan continues his unhappy staring into space. His shoulders slump - he
resumes his seat.

  
Suddenly a startled expression flashes across his face. He rises to his feet
and utters several startled sentences in Chinese. The next moment he patters
out of scene as we -

  
DISSOLVE TO:

  
Chan, entering his stateroom. He goes to a little desk - takes out envelopes,
paper - seizes pen and starts to write.

  
INSERT: _

**_"DEAR MR. LOFTON:   
TO SAVE EMBARRASSMENT I

WILL SAY NOTHING TO ANYONE AND WILL

NOT MAKE ARREST UNTIL SHIP DOCKS.

  
CHARLIE CHAN."_**

_He folds the letter, seals and addresses it to Dr. Lofton - then quickly
starts another letter with identically the same words, addressed to Mr.
Benbow. As he completes this -

  
DISSOLVE TO:

  
Chan, sealing a fifth envelope - showing five addresses to Mr. Tait, Dr.
Lofton, Keane, Ross and Benbow.

  
CUT TO:

  
EXTERIOR DECK

  
It is misty, and the fog horn is blowing at intervals. Mark and Pam stand
together near the rail. _

**PAM: Are you glad the trip's over?   
  
MARK: Yes. When I turn Tait over to his son, tonight -- I'm free.

**

_THE FOG HORN BLOWS AGAIN_

**PAM:** _(Smiling up at him)_ **Are you glad our quarrel's over, too?   
  
MARK:** _(Smiles)_** Is it? I don't like quarrels.

  
PAM:** _(Accusingly)_ **You Pacifist!

  
MARK: Perhaps I should have said -- I don't like quarreling with you.

  
PAM: That's better.

  
MARK: Well -- if I shouldn't see you again --

  
PAM:** _(Quickly)_ **Oh, I hope you will.

  
MARK: In case I don't -- I just want to tell you -- it's been fun knowing you.
You're awfully nice, you know. I don't know what I'd've done --**

_FOG HORN BLOWS

  
Mark tries to talk through shriek of horn, shouting indistinct words. Pam,
with an ear cocked toward him, tries to hear what he says. Suddenly, the sound
of the horn ceases.

_

**PAM: Of course I will, if you really want me to.   
  
MARK:** _(Surprised)_ **Want you to what?

  
PAM: Marry you -- isn't that what you were asking me?

  
MARK: Oh, no. I was saying - I supposed you'd marry some nice boy and be very
happy.

  
PAM: Oh -- I'm sorry.

  
MARK:** _(Suddenly)_** But look here! If I had asked you, you mean you'd
really have said yes?

  
PAM: But you just explained you didn't ask me.

  
MARK: If I do ask you -- will you promise you'll say yes again?

  
PAM: If I promise to say yes -- will you promise you'll ask me again? **

_Mark impulsively crushes her in his arms and kisses her.

  
FOG HORN BLOWS

  
Chan enters.

_

**CHAN:** _(Coughing discreetly, and smiling widely)_ **So sorry to interrupt bitter quarrel --**

!["So sorry to interrupt bitter quarrel
--"](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript30.jpg)

_They separate -_

**PAM: Oh, it isn't exactly a quarrel, any more --   
  
CHAN:** _(To Mark)_** May I ask great favor?

  
MARK: Certainly. What?

  
CHAN: When I leave Mr. Minchin's dinner - come quickly after me, please. I
need help very much.

  
MARK: Yes, of course.

  
CHAN: Thank you so much.** _(He exits) _

_Pam and Mark immediately resume their embrace --

  
DISSOLVE TO:

  
DINING SALON

  
The Minchin dinner has reached the stage of demi-tasse and cigarettes.

  
The table is lavishly decorated - Max doing the thing properly, even providing
comic paper hats for the guests.

  
At the table are the Benbows, Dr. Lofton, Ross, Tate, Keane, Mark, Pam, Mrs.
Luce -- the Minchins.

  
AS WE DISOLVE IN -

  
We hear the buzz of conversation - the clink of glasses.

  
Dr. Lofton is speaking:

_

**LOFTON: But, barring these unhappy occurrences, I hope you have experienced some measure of the enjoyment you all anticipated when we began this world tour. I thank you.**

_He sits down to the accompaniment of general applause._

**MAX: Wonder where our Chinese friend is? I invited him to the dinner and he said he was coming.   
  
PAM: Oh, I think he'll be here. He told me he would.

  
MAX: How about a few words from Mr. Keane?

**

_As Keane rises -

  
CUT TO

  
Chan, crouching in corridor slipping one of the addressed envelopes under a
door.

  
He hurries to another door across the corridor and slips the remaining
envelope under that door.

  
CUT TO

  
DINING SALON:

  
Ross is just concluding his speech:

_

**ROSS: ...in conclusion, I admit that the murder of Mr. Drake in that stuffy room in London, was a mysterious occurrence; **_(Chan enters in time to overhear - and quietly slips into his seat at the table)_** but to me, it seems stranger still to realize that at this moment we are dining with a man who has committed three murders, attempted a fourth - who sits here listening to us, and who, within an hour, will walk off this ship still free and still unidentified and unpunished.** _(He pauses)_ **And now I think we should hear from our generous host, Mr. Minchin.**

_There is applause as Max rises._

**MAX: Ladies and gents; long's the subject been brung up I don't mind tellin' you that with all this shootin' goin' on, and all these people gettin' bumped off, me and the wife figured we might as well stayed home.** _(He pauses)_ **How about a few words from our friend, the Chinese Dick?   
  
TAIT:** _(Sarcastically)_** Yes. Perhaps he will explain why he failed to get
his man. **

_Chan Rises._

!["Ladies and gentlemen..."](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/cars
criptccatparty.jpg.w300h231.jpg)

**CHAN: Ladies and gentlemen: Man who fights law always loses; same as grasshopper is always wrong in argument with chicken. It is only once in a very long time that man bites own nose, but happy to say - murderer has kindly done so. You have all asked questions; perhaps I can now entertain with few explanations. **_(Pausing, glancing around at members of party) _**Mr. Drake was murdered in London by mistake. How? Murderer entered wrong room. He intended to kill Honywood. Why? Because Honywood ran away with his wife, and when pair went, they stole two bags of diamonds.** _(Holding out the two bags of pebbles)_ **These were to remind him of what they had done.** _(He pauses a moment)_ **Murderer's name was Jim Everhard - formerly illicit diamond buyer, South Africa. I have informed him that to save embarrassment, I will not mention his present name and will not make arrest until ship docks. Thank you so much.**

_There is a general look of consternation among the diners, then one after
another they turn to look at each other, each wondering which is the murderer.
Chan, without any formality, bows and quickly exits. Almost immediately, Mark
rises, speaks a word to Pam and follows._

**MRS. LUCE: Well, sitting here in the company of a person who did these things, gives me the creeps. I'm going to my cabin.**

_There is a general breaking up of the dinner. Diners rise and start crowding
round Max and Sadie, as we

San Francisco Bay.

which comes alongside. The health inspectors clamber up a rope ladder which
has been thrown over the side.

  
CUT TO:

  
INTERIOR TAIT'S CABIN -

Mark is in scene. Chan has just pulled out Mark's bag, and is showing the
label to Mark.

  
IN A CLOSE SHOT

We see that it has been cut out, and key removed.

_

**CHAN: Just as I thought; key is gone.   
  
MARK: Where is it?

  
CHAN: Where I want it -- now. On the person of murderer.

**

_Mark looks over at Tait's berth, where his hand luggage is neatly piled._

**MARK: Tait --**

_He glances quickly at Chan. Mark sees the envelope on the floor which Chan
has shoved under Tait's door. He is about to&nbsp_place_holder;pick it up when
Chan stops him._

**CHAN: No -- leave that.**

_They are startled by the piercing shriek of a woman, followed by two more in
quick succession._

**MARK:** _(Startled)_ **Pamela!**

_As the two start out of cabin door on deck, loud yells are heard._

**MAN'S VOICE: Man overboard! Man overboard!   
  
MARK:** _(Seizing Chan's arm)_** Too late! That's your man -- he's gone. **

_They run to the rail where the spotlight of launch is now playing on water
over the ship's side.

  
Three or four life-preservers, with ropes attached to them, have been thrown.
In the center of these, badly frightened, is a man.

  
A man in the launch hauls the figure over to the side to safety.

_

**MARK:** _(Leaning over the rail as he discovers it is Benbow)_** Is that your man, Mr. Chan?   
  
CHAN: No. Come quickly. **

_They exit down the deck.

  
CUT TO:

  
FLASH of Mrs. Benbow, as she tearfully explains to a small group of
passengers:

_

**MRS. BENBOW: All the way round the world, I've been telling that idiot not to sit on the rail!**

_CUT TO:

  
STATEROOM OF DR. LOFTON

  
As he enters, stoops, and picks up letter addressed to him. He opens it - as
he reads, an expression of startled amazement comes over his face. He sits,
staring straight ahead, with the expression of a man desperately worried.

  
CUT TO:

  
KEANE IN HIS STATEROOM

  
He is holding a similar letter in his hand. An expression of terror comes over
his face, he stares ahead, as if paralyzed with fear.

  
CUT TO:

  
ROSS IN HIS STATEROOM

  
We see him reading the letter. He sinks on the side of his berth, with an
expression of incredulous astonishment on his face. He stares wide-eyed into
space.

  
CUT TO:

  
FLASH OF TAIT IN HIS STATEROOM

  
As he stoops to pick up the envelope on the floor of his cabin. He tears it
open, reads it, crumples it in his hand with a snarl, and then stands, a
picture of fury.

_

_CUT TO:

  
INTERIOR CHAN'S CABIN

  
Chan is showing Mark a dummy silhouette which he has rigged up at his window,
where the silken shades are drawn tight. It consists of a broom, a coat hanger
with Chan's coat hung on it, a heavy Turkish towel - surmounted by Chan's hat.

_

![Chan is showing Mark a dummy
silhouette...](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript31.jpg)

_Chan picks up a long light cord, with a button switch at one end - a double
socket at the other. He screws socket with the lamp into the electric light
fixture, and then with the switch tests it, flashing light on and off. Next,
he takes the long cord, opens the door of his cabin, looks up and down the
deck, which is in misty darkness, beckons Mark to follow him, closes the door.
He starts to lay the cord across the deck in direction of a lifeboat,
immediately opposite his cabin. Chan and Mark clamber into the lifeboat.

  
We see his cabin suddenly lighted up, and clearly defined against the silk
curtain, is the silhouette of Chan. Chan presses the button and the light in
the cabin is extinguished, leaving it in darkness.

_

![We see his cabin suddenly lighted
up...](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript27.jpg)

_CUT TO:

  
CORNER OF MAIN COMPANIONWAY

  
Dr. Lofton meets Pam.

_

**LOFTON:** _(In an angry tone)_ **Have you seen that Chinese detective anywhere?   
  
PAM:** _(Rather startled at his tone)_** No, I haven't. Not since dinner. **

_Lofton turns away.

  
CUT TO:

  
KEANE, on a dimly lighted deck. He meets Sadie Minchin.

_

**KEANE: Excuse me, please -- do you know where Mr. Chan is?   
  
SADIE: No, I ain't seen 'im. What do you want with him?

**

_Keane doesn't answer - turns away. Sadie watches him with growing suspicion.

  
CUT TO:

  
CORNER OF SMOKING ROOM

  
Tait enters, apparently very furious. He looks about as if searching for
someone, then turns angrily and exits.

  
CUT TO:

  
THE LIFEBOAT - showing Chan and Mark, as they crouch, watching Chan's dark
stateroom opposite.

  
A tall figure comes stamping down deck, stops at door of Chan's cabin; knocks
furiously on the door, and receiving no response, looks about and dashes out
of scene. The man is seen to be Keane.

  
Mark turns to Chan with a look of inquiry. Chan makes a sign to Mark for
silence. Another figure is seen approaching.

  
It is Mr. Tait. He stops at Chan's door; knocks. A deck hand comes to him.

_

**TAIT: Have you seen that Chinaman anywhere?   
  
DECKHAND: No sir.

**

_Deckhand goes on. Tait looks angrily up and down the deck, and in turn goes
away.

  
Mark looks at Chan who again gives him the signal for silence.

  
Suddenly, along the misty deck, a stealthy sound is heard. A third person
approaches. As Chan catches sight of a tall figure, he snaps on the light of
the cabin, showing the silhouette.

  
The figure glides up to the window -- HIS BACK TO CAMERA - we see a heavy gun
raised, aimed at the center of the silhouette of Chan - and a shot is fired.

  
Instantly, into the scene, leap Chan and Mark, pinioning the figure from
behind. Chan wrests the gun from the man, holding his arms behind him, while
Mark quickly opens door of cabin. They force the man into the room just as the
Captain and two of the crew race up to the door.

  
In the light of the cabin, they turn the man around. WE SEE THAT IT IS ---
_ROSS_.

_

_Ross stands for an instant, with a wild, menacing glare in his eyes. Then,
suddenly he makes a leap - as if to escape. He is seized by all, and is held
until Chan places the handcuffs on his wrists._

**CHAN:** _(Takes coat from hanger - points to hole in back - says sorrowfully)_ **Too bad - my best suit -- Mr. Everhard.   
  
CAPTAIN: Everhard? I thought his name was Ross.

  
CHAN: No. Jim Everhard - formerly of South Africa. **_(He takes the figure of
the three monkeys from his pocket) _**Your warning, Mr. Everhard - see
nothing, hear nothing, say nothing. Maybe should be 'nother monkey - DO
NOTHING!

  
MARK: How about the key, Mr. Chan?

  
CHAN: Ah - thank you, so much. **

_He takes from his pocket, the safe-deposit key on the platinum chain, and
shows it to Ross._

**Kindly search him for duplicate of this key, found in hand of murdered man in London.   
  
ROSS: **_(With a slight shrug) _**Never mind - it's in my vest pocket.**

_Mark takes it out._

**Well, you've got me. But will you tell me something?   
  
CHAN: If I may.

  
ROSS: Where did I slip up? How did you know me?

  
CHAN:** _(With a bland smile)_** I wasn't sure -- until just now.

  
ROSS:** _(Amazed)_** You weren't? Then what about the letter you wrote me?

  
CHAN: Oh, I wrote everybody the same letter. But you are only one who came
here to shoot my best suit.

  
CAPTAIN: What do you want to do with him, Charlie?

  
CHAN: Take charge please, while I send immediate wireless to Inspector Duff in
hospital.**

_As Chan starts from cabin,

  
DISSOLVE TO

  
DOOR OF WIRELESS ROOM -

  
Chan dictating to operator. Beside him, arm in arm, are Mark and Pam.

_

**CHAN:** _(Dictating to operator)_ **Honorable Duff - kindly providence has sprinkled your contemptible substitute with a shower of luck - Ross is under arrest. Honorable Mr. Kennaway and Miss Potter join in best wishes before joining to receive blessings of astonished relatives.**

_He turns and smiles at Mark and Pam._

![He turns and smiles at Mark and
Pam.](sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/carscript33.jpg)

**Mistake?   
  
MARK: No mistake - fortunately, quite true.

**

_He puts his arm around Pam's waist, as she smiles up at him.
