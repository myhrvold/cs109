FADE IN:

EXT. LIMBO - DAY/NIGHT

A heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And out of that
primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying toward the camera in slow motion.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH (O.S.)

I believe there's a place where the restless souls wander. Burdened by the
weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter Heaven...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK. A warrior whose
baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony mask war paint.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH (O.S.)

And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly searching
for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the hopes that somehow, some
day...

&nbsp_place_holder;

The figure on horseback sweeps past us, disappearing once again into the mists
of time.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH (V.O.)

... they will be reunited with the ones they love.

&nbsp_place_holder;

DISSOLVE TO:

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. DOCS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Present day. The Crow settles on a shipping container, tilts its head,
watching...

  
SUPER TITLE:

  
"CITY OF ANGELS - OCTOBER 29TH - LA NOCHE DE SAN LUCAS"

  
CLOSE ON A PAIR OF HANDS tearing open a tiny glassine envelope filled with
powder - our drug du jour - Trinity. The face of the envelope has been stamped
with an image - a cartoon imp with a shit-eating gring giving us the thumbs-up
sign.

  
A MAN lowers his face to the envelope, snorts up the powder. The man discards
the glassine envelope...

  
FOLLOWING THE ENVELOPE

  
as it flutters to the ground, landing "imp-side" up. Let the rush begin.

  
PULL BACK TO REVEAL

  
Garbage-poisoned waters wreathed in fog. Although once part of a thriving
shipping industry, decades of decline have seen these docks become a hellish
dumping ground. Case in point:

  
A FATHER AND HIS YOUNG SON

  
are kneeling next to one another at the end of a pier, their arms linked
together, then tied behind their backs. DANNY CORVEN (8) is quietly sobbing.
ASHE (late 20s), tries to calm the frightened boy.

&nbsp_place_holder;

DANNY

I'm sorry, Dad...I'm sorry... I didn't mean to look...

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

It's okay, Danny. It's okay...

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO (O.S.)

Lights...

&nbsp_place_holder;

A bright light comes on. Ashe and Danny turn their heads to avoid the glare.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO (O.S.)

...camera...

&nbsp_place_holder;

CLOSE ON

  
A camcorder lens as it auto-focuses, bringing Danny's distorted face into view
via the lens' reflection.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO (O.S.)

..._action_.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CAMERA FINDS Ashe and Danny's executioners, CURVE, KALI, SPIDER MONKEY, and
NEMO.

  
NEMO, a post-modern sleaze-hound, circles Danny and Ashe with a camcorder. He
Pats Ashe's face.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO

Make-up.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY, lean and gangly, crouches next to Ashe, holding a marigold in
his hand.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

Flowers for the dead, Senor?

&nbsp_place_holder;

CAMERA POV (CLOSE ON ASHE'S EYE)

  
Ashe stares directly into the camera.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

No? Suite yourself, then.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Spider Monkey tucks the flower behind his ear. Danny is praying now, MUMBLING
a Catholic School litany.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

You're wasting your breath, angelito. Nobody up there's listening.

&nbsp_place_holder;

WHOOSH!

  
We cut to an extreme high-angle shot - God's omniscient POV, perhaps.

  
CURVE

  
leans up against his motorcycle a few yards away - big, burly, shaved head, a
ciggie hanging from his lips. He's got a custom paint-job on his pearl drop
gas tank - a buxom blonde doing the "wild thing" with the Grim Reaper. Curve's
also the one who just dusted himself

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

(hyped on drugs)

Let's get this over with. Judah's waiting.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Kali, a cold-eyed heavy-metal femme with a killer's casual stoicism, is
methodically loading bullets into her revolver. She's taking her own sweet
time, in defiance of Curve. There's a tension between them. Finally, she
flicks her wrist, snaps the revolver shut. Kali walks up to them...

&nbsp_place_holder;

DANNY

I'm scared, Dad.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

I know...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe turns to his executioners, pleading with them...

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Listen to me, please. He's just a kid. Let him go. He can't hurt you. He
doesn't even know who you are...

&nbsp_place_holder;

_...and puts a bullet through Danny's chest_. Ashe SCREAMS.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

NO!!!

&nbsp_place_holder;

Danny's body slumps forward, dragging Ashe down next to him. Ashe stares into
his son's lifeless eyes.

  
Curve saunters over, stares down at Ashe, flicks his cigarette butt off into
the water.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

Nothing personal, sport. Guess you were just in the wrong place at the wrong
time.

&nbsp_place_holder;

BANG! BANG! BANG! Curve FIRES a gun into Ashe's back. As Ashe crumples...

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

Dump 'em. Let's get this cluster-fuck on the road.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

  
motions to Kali and Spider Monkey. Together, the three of them heave Ashe and
Danny into the ocean.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

Bon voyage, shitheads.

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. OCEAN DEPTHS - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe and Danny sink down into the murky underworld, taking their place amongst
a thousand other deep-sixed dreams.

  
ASHE'S POV

  
falling further and further away from the light of the surface world. Bit by
bit, Ashe's struggles subside. All we hear now is an ever-slowing HEARTBEAT.
Darkness begins to close in around us, womblike, peaceful...

  
...AND OUT OF THE DARKNESS,

  
something takes shape - a CROW. Winging its way from Ashe's dream-like death
up through watery depths into a smog-bound cityscape...

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. CITY OF ANGELS - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

The Crow flies over a bridge with spans the Styx - the city's polluted, man-
made river.

  
THE CROW

  
rides the thermals above an urban sprawl riven by fires, floods, and
earthquakes. Smog hangs in the air like an army of ever-present ghosts. We
pass over a roof where someone has painted a smart-ass welcome mat for the
benefit of anyone flying overhead - "GO BACK". Nevertheless, we continue on.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH (V.O.)

They say that time cancels pain. I don't know about that. Eight years ago I
lost two of my best friends. Two thousand miles later I find I'm still living
in the past...

&nbsp_place_holder;

THE CROW

  
sweeps down into man-made caverns of pigeon-shit concrete and grimy glass.
Through the bird's eyes we glimpse the city's silent HOMELESS. Automobile
hulks littering the streets like insect husks. The shifting searchlights of
police helicopters...

  
WE PASS OVER SARAH'S ROOFTOP

  
The Crow circles downward...

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH (V.O.)

Every night when I close my eyes the dreams come. That's how the dead talk to
us, I guess. In the dark, when our souls are off wandering...

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

The Crow lands next to an open window. It perches on the edge, looking into
the loft.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH (V.O.)

I just wish I understood what they were telling me.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CROW'S POV (ANAMORPHIC)

  
SARAH, early 20s, lies asleep in bed. She stirs, troubled by uneasy dreams,
rolls over, opens her eyes...

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. SARAH'S LOFT, SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

As Sarah rises the Crow flits away like yesterday's memory. Sarah's not sure
whether or not she dreamed the bird. GABRIEL, the cat Sarah inherited from
Eric and Shelly, is perched on the end of the bed.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

Hey, Gabriel...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah gives the cat an obligatory behind-the-ear scratch, then climbs from
bed, making her way across the loft.

  
SARAH'S ARTIST LOFT

  
is furnished in thrift-store treasures. The loft has an earthy warmth to it,
in stark contrast to the urban decay outside - an island amidst a sea of
unrest, dominated by an arching half-circle window through which Sarah can
view the local wildlife on the streets below.

  
ON SARAH'S CANVASSES

  
Turbulent oils reminiscent of history's brooding symbolist painters. Give
Sarah's childhood inspiration, the subject matter is no real surprise.

  
CAMERA ISOLATES a work-in-progress. The painting depicts a woman resembling
Sarah being cradled in the arms of her pale-faced lover, surrounded by a sea
of watchful dead.

  
SARAH

  
reaches the shower, strips off her clothes. Her back and upper arms are
decorated with graceful tattoo work - a pair of black angel wings sweeping
over her shoulder blades. She's got a ring in her navel, another in a
nipple...

  
In short, the skate-waif we knew back in Detroit has matured quite a bit since
that fateful Devil's Night. Sarah shuts here eyes, turns her face up into the
spray. For a brief second we see a flash of...

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe's death. Plunging into the icy waters, down into darkness. Just as
suddenly we are back in...

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah's eyes snap open. She holds a hand out to the shower wall, takes a
moment to collect herself.

  
Troubled, Sarah climbs from the shower, shrugs on some clothes. Among her
accourterments is a necklace featuring a silver ankh, the symbol of eternity.

  
As Sarah sites in front of her vanity we catch sight of the irony mask that
used to hang by Shelly's mirror. Next to the mask is a...

  
TARNISHED WEDDING RING

  
Once Shelly's. There's an inscription inside - "FOREVER".

  
Sarah fingers the ring a moment, glancing at the irony mask. Lots of memories.
Lots of ghosts.

  
Gabriel creeps up, MEOWING forlornly.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

(wistfully)

Me too.

&nbsp_place_holder;

She threads the ring onto her necklace, letting it fall next to the ankh, then
slips the silver chain over her head. Sarah stands, pulls on a jacket, heads
out.

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. SARAH'S LOFT, STREET - DUSK

&nbsp_place_holder;

An ill-wind kicks up trash and grit. Sarah glances down. Dozens of the
glassine imp envelopes swirl around Sarah's feet like confetti. One of the
envelopes has stuck to her heel. As she peels it off, she catches sight of...

&nbsp_place_holder;

A PALE FACE

  
in a shadowed entryway. It's a TEENAGED GIRL (16), strung out on drugs. The
girl cowers in a narrow stairway, hugging herself, shivering from withdrawal.

  
Sarah draws closer, notices some of the grinning imp drug sachets at the
girl's feet. The girl shies away, frightened, suspicious.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

(dryly)

Nice place you've got here.

&nbsp_place_holder;

GRACE

(a muttered whisper)

No place else to go.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah can't help but recognize a part of herself in this lost soul.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

Gotta name?

&nbsp_place_holder;

GRACE

Grace. So what?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

Listen, Grace, how does some hot coffee sound? Maybe a little food?

&nbsp_place_holder;

GRACE

What do you want?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

Nothing. Guess you just remind me of someone I used to know.

&nbsp_place_holder;

After a moment, Grace offers a reluctant nod. Sarah helps her from the
entryway, into the warmth of the dying light. Grace blinks, shields her eyes.

  
As they walk away down the street, camera rises up to include...

  
THE CROW

  
perched on a nearby rooftop, watching them.

  
CUT TO:

EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

the Gargoyle is an usassuming ink shop - the sole oasis of light in an
otherwise desolated block populated by derelict warehouse buildings.
Flickering neon BUZZES in the window.

  
Nearby is a battered road sign - "END CITY LIMITS". Someone has spray-painted
"OF THE FUCKING WORLD" over "city limits". In the distance, the bridge of the
River Styx rises through the mist like a skeletal dinosaur.

  
SUPER TITLE:

  
"OCTOBER 30TH - LA NOCHE DE LA SANTA MUERTE"

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

CLOSE ON a sparking tattoo "gun", the needle WHIRRING as it travels over a
patch of Vaseline-smeared skin.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH (V.O.)

Almost finished. Doing okay?

&nbsp_place_holder;

CUSTOMER (V.O.)

Yeah, stings a little.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH (V.O.)

That's why they call me the Mistress of Pain.

&nbsp_place_holder;

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Sarah expertly guiding the needle, wearing glasses,
surgical gloves, concentrating.

  
Sarah's buzz-headed CUSTOMER sits in a ratty dentist's chair. Sarah is
finishing coloring a Japanese dragon which winds its way over the man's
forearm. She makes another line of color then sits back, smoothing more
Vaseline over the man's arm. She picks up a jeweler's loupe, makes an
adjustment on her needle...

  
Behind Sarah we glimpse the cluttered tattoo shop - walls covered with sheets
of flash (ready-made art), bookshelves crammed with reference works. Sarah's
partner, NOAH, a chain-smoking proto-punk Brit, consults with a YOUNG GRUNGE
COUPLE.

  
LATER -

  
Noah is closing up shop, while Sarah sterilizes some needles in an autoclave.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

What a downer - this kid wanted me to tattoo "If you're reading this, you're
too close" on his bleedin' bum!

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah smiles. Noah fires up a fag, flops down into a dentist chair. The two
slip into a familiar, good-natured banter.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

Christ, I'm knackered.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

Beats pushing ink in Detroit.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

That it does, Princess, that it does.

(remembering)

Oh, I bought you a little present...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Noah reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls something out. It's a handmade
candy sugar skull with a little strip of paper glued to the bottom - a
fortune.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

They do 'em for the Day of the Dead.

(tossing the skull to Sarah)

Nice, huh? Necrophagia, Princess. Eat the dead.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

(reading fortune)

"Life is just a dream on the way to death." I like that.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah studies the skull, then pops it in her mouth, nodding. Noah rises,
stretching.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

Want to grab a beer, then?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

No, I gotta go home. Haven't been sleeping much lately.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

So, what's the dirty dog's name?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

I've just been having some weird dreams.

(reflecting)

You ever dream that you're dying someone else's death?

&nbsp_place_holder;

Outside we hear a MOTORCYCLE pulling up, then someone KNOCKS on the front
door.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

(calling out)

Sorry, we're closed.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

  
appears outside. He POUNDS harder on the door.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

Open the fucking door!

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

  
stands, moves to the door.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

Look, I said we're...

&nbsp_place_holder;

BANG! Curve kicks open the door and storms in. He PUNCHES Noah in the nose,
then heads straight for Sarah.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

You think what you did to me is funny? Some kind of joke?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

What are you talking about?!

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

I'm talking about the fucking tattoo you gave me! I took off the bandages.
Look...!!!

&nbsp_place_holder;

Curve rips open his shirt, revealing his chest.

  
CURVE'S TATTOO

  
_It's a crow, rendered in bold slashes of black_. Or is it? Upon closer
examination the crow looks like something else - two demons fighting. The
design is a classic ambiguous figure - like the picture of the woman in front
of a vanity which can also be seen as a skull.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

A crow...

Damn right, it's a crow. And did I ask for a fucking bird on my chest? Did I?!

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah shakes her head.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

_Then what-the-fuck is it doing there?!_

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

I don't know, I was just going from the design you gave me...

&nbsp_place_holder;

SMACK! Curve backhands Sarah across the face. Noah rushes forward, blood still
running from his nose.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

Stop it!

&nbsp_place_holder;

Curve pulls an automatic from his waist-band and points the gun at Noah. Noah
freezes...

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

What's it going to be, hero? Ready to kiss your faggot-ass good-bye? I think
so. I think you're shitting yourself you're so goddamn ready.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Curve snaps open an imp bag of his favorite drug, snorts up the contents. He
presses the gun against Noah's forehead.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH (O.S.)

Over here, ass-hole...

&nbsp_place_holder;

As Curve turns, Sarah squeezes a bottle of tattoo ink into the killer's eyes,
blinding him.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

Agh!!! SHIT!!!

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah plants one of her Doc Marten boots in Curve's groin. He SCREAMS, doubles
over. Sarah pulls the automatic from his grasp and trains it on him.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

_Get up_.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Curve cups his balls, slowly rises. His eyes are glowing with manic intensity.
A slow smile creeps across Curve's face. He backs away towards the front door.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

Shoulda killed me while you had the chance, sugarplum. Be seeing you.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Curve smashes his fist into the neon sign, then ducks out thedoor. Moments
later we hear his motorcycle ROAR to life. He takes off, ENGINE SCREAMING away
into the night.

  
Sarah lowers the gun, takes a deep breath, looks to Noah.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

You okay?

&nbsp_place_holder;

Noah wipes his bloody nose, looks to the floor where Curve discarded the drug
sachet, shakes his head in disgust.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

Fuck me, wonder what they'll be snorting next?

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah shakes her head, at wits end.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

I just can't do this anymore... I'm so tired of this.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Noah pulls Sarah toward him, gives her a big hug.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

Easy there, luv. It'll all work out.

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE, - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah, still clutching Curve's gun, hurries to her Galaxy 500 which is parked
along the nearby train tracks.

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. SARAH'S GALAXY - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah moves behind the wheel, dumps the gun on the seat, and rests her head in
her hands. As Sarah raises her head...

  
SARAH'S POV (THROUGH WINDSHIELD)

  
The Crow is perched on the hood of her car. Sarah HONKS her horn in
frustration. The Crow doesn't move.

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE, ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah rushes out of her car, screaming at the bird.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

Get out of here! Go!!!

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah FIRES a wild shot into the sky. The Crow files off into the night. Sarah
collapses against the hood of her Galaxy and starts to cry.

  
CUT TO:

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

The Crow soars away from the Gargoyle, toward the beckoning lights of
Downtown. In the distance, a flashing "JESUS SAVES" sign draws our attention
to a monolithic tower.

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

The Crow makes its way towards the decaying tower, which is crowned by a
weather-worn campanile. The campanile is a complex arabesque of rusted iron
scrollwork, like something Antonio Gaudi conjured up from an art nouveau
fever-dream.

  
Just as the Crow is about to reach the campanile, it banks away. We, however,
continue to rush onward, right through one of the dark openings in the
scrollwork...

INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

SCRITCH! SCRITCH! All we see is black, then some vague, shiny reflections...

  
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a stag beetle, imprisoned within a box, leashed to
a nail with a piece of thread. We were tight on its shiny carapace. The beetle
strains at its leash, moving in a perpetual circle around the nail.

  
CAMERA MOVES UP

  
over the side of the box. Although mere inches in height, this enclosure might
as well be the Great Wall as far as our little member of the Coleoptera is
concerned.

  
AS THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK

  
we see crime lord Judah Earl's lair in all its sepulchral glory...

  
Dark, filled with shadows. The decor is a cross between ruinous palatial
splendor and a SoHo industrial art installation. The upper reaches of the
campanile are laced with a spiderweb network of steel girders.

  
Look close enough and you might see _PEOPLE bound to the supporting pillars_,
like the half-glimpsed shapes crouching at the foot of your bed in the middle
of the night.

  
VOICES draw our attention to an area partitioned off by chain-mail curtains.
CAMERA MOVES IN towards a break in the curtains. We linger there for a
tantalizing moment...

&nbsp_place_holder;

JUDAH (V.O.)

Talk to me, Sibyl. Tell me what you see.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SIBYL (V.O.)

I see Death returning from the veil of tears. He has your name on his tongue.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Now we plunge in through the curtains...

  
The "camera" consists of a series of lenses and mirrors which project images
from the outside world onto a circular table, offering the ultimate
voyeuristic view of the crumbling cityscape. TWO FIGURES stand with their
backs to us, studying the camera's view. The first is...

  
JUDAH EARL,

  
A sinewy, slash-mouthed Byronic figure with a guttural voice. Old before his
time, touched by childhood visions of his own death. The tower is Judah's
prison in more ways than one.

  
SIBYL, Judah's blind oracle, waits by his side. Attractive, though of
indeterminate sex. His/her dour features are hidden beneath a black cowl.

&nbsp_place_holder;

JUDAH

(fatalistic)

It's finally beginning, isn't it? What mask will Death wear, can you tell me
that?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SIBYL

I see the face of one of your victims.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Judah lifts his head up and we see his luminous amber eyes for the first time.
A kind of madness dances within them.

&nbsp_place_holder;

JUDAH

All my sins remembered.

INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah sits in bed, cigarette burning in one hand, a half-filled wine glass in
the other. She turns out her light, looks to the window and the cityscape
beyond - as if the answers were lying out there in the steam-cloaked streets.

  
CUT TO:

  
SOMEONE'S SPEED-INDUCED POV. Performers flaunt their flesh on a raised stage.
CROWDS OF SEXUAL LIBERTINES and CUTTING EDGE FETISHISTS writhe as one on the
dance floor. Lots of rubber, latex strap bodices, Victorian hoop skirts - it's
a modern-day De Sade's wet-dream.

  
REVERSE ANGLE

  
on Curve as he pushes his way upstairs and through the tangle of flesh.

  
He pulls up to a bar, takes a seat alongside Kali and Spider Monkey (who's
amusing himself with a Viewmaster). CLICK, CLICK - we see

  
MONKEY'S POV - as the 3-D tableaus rotate into position

  
THE BARTENDER,

  
a barrel-chested Samoan, sets a drink down in front of Curve, nods a greeting.
Curve sits back, opens his shirt, nudges Spider Monkey.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

Spider Monkey, what's this tattoo look like to you?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

This a test?

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

Come on, man, just tell me what you see.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Spider Monkey inspects Curve's chest.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

A bird.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

(annoyed)

Think about it a minute. Don't you see two demons?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

Nope. I see a bird.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

Ah, fuck you, then.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Curve lifts up his beer bottle. ECU from within the beer as the amber liquid
rushes towards us...

  
DISSOLVE TO:

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. UNDERWATER REALM - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Air bubbles escaping, blood. Ashe is drowning again, the orbs of his eyes
bulging outwards. Over this we hear a WOMAN'S SCREAM and...

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah bolts up in bed, knocking her wine glass to the floor, SHATTERING it.
She's choking, gasping for breath. Her heart is hammering within her chest.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

...ohgodohgodohgod...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Suddenly she catches sight of a shadow on the wall before her - _a GIANT BIRD
slowly spreading its black wings_.

  
Sarah turns to the window. The Crow is perched just outside.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

What do you want from me?!

&nbsp_place_holder;

The Crow CAWS, then takes flight.

  
CLOSE ON SARAH

  
Calm now, realization and a sense of purpose dawning.

  
CUT TO:

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

We descend towards the empty docks, pushing out into the mist-shrouded water,
then down into the ocean's murky depths.

  
PRESENTLY THE BODIES OF ASHE AND DANNY

  
come into view, caught up in a tangle of razor wire.

  
CLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE

  
Unaltered by the ravages of time. His eyelids flicker, dreaming. A SINGLE TEAR
escapes, flowing down his cheek. We push on INSIDE HIS HEAD...

  
We see brief MEMORY FLASHES of he and Danny together...

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. ASHE'S GARAGE - NIGHT/DAY (MEMORIES)

&nbsp_place_holder;

Danny stretched out on the floor of their garage, painting a picture...

  
Danny and Ashe rough-housing, having a water fight...

  
Danny sitting in Ashe's lap as Ashe reads aloud from a story.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

(reading)

"...midway through our life's journey I came to myself within a dark wood
where the straight way was lost..."

&nbsp_place_holder;

Danny asleep, curled up next to his father. Ashe reaches out and strokes
Danny's hair...

&nbsp_place_holder;

CLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE

  
_His dead eyes suddenly open_. Confusion. Pain. Fear. A stream of bubbles
rushes from his mouth, obscuring our view.

  
ASHE'S POV

  
As the bubbles clear, _Danny's face comes into focus just a few inches from
his own_.

  
Ashe panics, jerks back. The razor-wire barbs cut into his flesh. The more he
struggles, the tighter the coils become, slashing his hands and face,
shredding his clothes. He's caught in his son's embrace, the two of them
thrashing about in a grotesque underwater ballet.

  
CUT TO:

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. RIVER STYX BRIDGE - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

The headlights of Sarah's Galaxy cut through the fog. She pulls up just in
time to see the Crow disappearing into the mist which cloaks the bridge. Sarah
follows, trying to keep up with the bird.

  
CUT TO:

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. UNDER WATER - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe's struggles become more and more violent. He thrashes, churning up a
cloud of bubbles. We are intercutting quickly now, between Ashe's turmoil
and...

  
CUT TO:

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah reaches the pier where Ashe and Danny were executed. She climbs from her
car...

flies on ahead, landing atop one of the piles, staring down into the water.

  
AND AS SARAH

  
starts toward the bird we...

Ashe tears his hands free, clawing his body away from the barbwire, swimming

FLASHBACKS

  
of subjective POVs. The killers walking down the jetty, marching Ashe and
Danny to their deaths and...

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

We are beneath the jetty now in the present, looking up through the slats as a
FIGURE (Sarah?) makes its way to the water...

  
Camera CRANES UP from beneath the jetty to reveal Sarah standing there in
silhouette...

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. UNDER WATER - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe is propelled towards the surface.

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. DOCKS COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

_Ashe suddenly bursts from the sea_ with his arms outstretched. A hellish
Venus on the half-shell. Gasping, full of terror and rage. He lets loose a
TORTURED HOWL.

  
ASHE

  
digs his fingers into the wood-rot pulp of the pilings and claws his way up to
the jetty. He collapses down onto the wooded slats.

  
ASHE

  
crouches before us, his face hidden from view. He reaches out his hand,
touching an unmistakable BLOOD STAIN... _Danny's blood stain. This triggers
more painful memories..._

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Images from Ashe and Danny's execution assault him. BANG!!! Kali FIRING her
gun. Ashe SCREAMING. Danny's body slumping forward like a marionette whose
strings have been severed.

  
CUT TO:

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT (PRESENT)

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe lifts his head, WAILING. He's covered from head to toe in ocean-bottom
silt. Blood from the razor-wire wounds has smeared across his face in patterns
which eerily recall the Crow make-up. Strips of the wire still cling to his
arms and chest, the barbs buried deep in his flesh.

  
Reliving the violent moment is more than his mind can bear. Ashe's eyes roll
up into his head. The world spins around him. But even as the lights are going
out, Ashe glimpses...

  
A DARK FIGURE

  
standing in front of him. It's the last thing Ashe sees before consciousness
escapes him.

  
SARAH

  
emerges from the shadows, staring down at Ashe in wonder.

  
CUT TO BLACK:

  
SUPER TITLE:

  
"OCTOBER 31ST - ALL HALLOWS EVE"

INT. SARAH'S LOFT - DUSK

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe opens his eyes. The mud-silt which covers his face has dried and cracked,
causing it to crumble away in flakes.

  
Ashe is lying on a cot in the middle of the loft. We see scattered images:
candles burning, a reilgious altar overflowing with trinkets, mirrors,
mannequins, canvases, and finally...

  
GABRIEL

  
perched at the end of the bed, watching Ashe intently.

  
SARAH

  
sits on the other side of the loft in a paint-smeared work-shirt, brush in
hand. She's studying a half-finished canvas, contemplating her next move.

  
CANVAS

  
The eerie scene depicting a woman on her death-bed being cradled in the arms
of her ghostly lover.

  
Sarah tenses, feeling Ashe's eyes burning into the back of her neck. She turns
around, sees Ashe.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

(disoriented)

...who are you?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

My name's Sarah. I had a dream about you. I saw them shoot you and your son...

(beat)

..._I saw you drowning._

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashes shuts his eyes a moment, trying to recall the imagery.

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

&nbsp_place_holder;

BANG! BANG! BANG! Curve FIRES a gun into Ashe's chest. Ashe crumples and we
are back at...

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. SARAH'S LOFT - DUSK

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe looks down at his chest, tracing his fingers over the area where bullet
holes _should_ be. Instead, he finds a series of indented welts.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

How did I survive?

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah suddenly comes to the terrible realization that _Ashe does not know he
has died_.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

(coming towards him)

You _didn't_.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe looks up at Sarah, uncomprehending.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

You're dead.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

No...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe stands, enraged. He starts toward Sarah. She backs away...

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Stop looking at me that way -- stop looking -- this isn't real, none of this
is real! I'm dreaming this.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

(shaking her head, frightened)

No.

&nbsp_place_holder;

The two of the struggle a moment, Ashe pushes Sarah back. Sarah reaches for
him, trying to restrain him, trying to somehow keep his rising terror in
check... she's not getting through to him, he can't be made to listen...

  
Finally, Sarah grabs a kitchen knife from the counter and _plunges it into
Ashe's chest._

  
Ashe gasps. He stares down at the incongruous sight of a knife-handle stickout
out from his sternum, then he yanks the knife back out. No pain. No wound. A
moment of shock, then...

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

(looking at her, a tortured whisper)

I'm dreaming this.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah tries to reach for Ashe again. He tears away from her, flinging her back
and running for the door.

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe stumbles from the doorway out onto the sidewalk. He rushes blindly up the
street.

  
CAMERA WHIP-PANS

  
from the fleeing Ashe to Sarah's window. On a pillar outside, the Crow is
waiting...

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT

Sarah rushes to the window, watching Ashe run. She SEES the Crow perched below
her. It takes wings, flying after Ashe...

  
CUT TO:

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. BRIDGE/GARAGE - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Beneath the arching span of a freeway bridge is a series of corrugated iron
sheds. CAMERA FOLLOWS as Ashe, exhausted fro his run, makes his way towards
them. The Crow flies on ahead, landing next to one of the doors, beckoning...

  
Ashe slides one of the RATTLING doors open...

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

As light spills in, we catch a glimpse of the humble auto repair garage -
tools, a few wrecks-in-progress, a motorcycle...

  
CAMERA ISOLATES a tempera painting on the floor that's been executed on
construction paper. A brush and a collection of paint canisters are scattered
around it, like the kind you might find in a primary school art class. Ashe
kneels next to the painting...

  
CLOSE ON PAINTING

  
An image rendered by a child's optimistic imagination - a crude father and
sone, respectively labeled "DAD" and "ME". A FOOTPRINT mars the otherwise
perfect memento. Ashe touches the figure labeled "ME", which triggers...

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe is working beneath a car. Danny is sprawled on the floor. He holds up the
painting in question.

&nbsp_place_holder;

DANNY

Hey, Dad...what color should I make the sun?

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Blue.

&nbsp_place_holder;

DANNY

There's no such thing.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

(playful)

No. Well there _should_ be.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Just then we hear a GUNSHOT coming from outside.

&nbsp_place_holder;

DANNY

(wide eyed)

What was that?

&nbsp_place_holder;

Danny climbs to his feet, moves outside...

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Danny, wait!

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe slides out from under the car.

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

&nbsp_place_holder;

From the back doorway, Ashe and Danny catch sight of Curve and his crew
executing someone beneath the freeway overpass. Curve's face is splattered
with blood. He turns and sees them...

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

See no evil.

&nbsp_place_holder;

EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

&nbsp_place_holder;

Now we're back at the pier. The memory flashes are coming faster and faster.
Danny is sobbing once again.

&nbsp_place_holder;

DANNY'S VOICE

I'm sorry, Dad...I'm sorry...

&nbsp_place_holder;

We see Kali raise her gun. BANG! There's the muzzle flash! Ashe SCREAMS...

&nbsp_place_holder;

NO!!!

CURVE'S VOICE

Nothing personal, sport.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SMASH CUT TO:

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (PRESENT)

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe is tearing the place apart, sobbing, knocking over racks of tools.
Finally, he sinks to his knees, his face a mask of tears.

  
Ashe spins, murderous rage in his eyes. Never startle an animal, right?

  
SARAH

  
stands in the doorway.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Why are you here?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

I don't know.

&nbsp_place_holder;

She stops herself -- she _does_ know, she just didn't want to admit it to
herself.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

I want to help you. I _need_ to.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah approaches, dropping by Ashe's side. She sees Danny's painting which
Ashe cradles protectively.

  
Ashe looks up at Sarah, his eyes full of questions.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Everything's so confused...

(anguished, touching the drawing)

Danny...

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

He's not here anymore.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah draws closer, touched by Ashe's inner struggle. She reaches out to him,
drawing him into her arms. He stares up at her, eyes distant.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

There's no moon...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah touches Ashe's face, calming him, trying to reach through his pain.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

You've been given another chance, Ashe -- to put the wrong things right...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah's eyes drop to the canisters of paint which have been scattered nearby.
She reaches for the canister of white and unscrews the lid, dipping her
fingers inside...

  
Sarah's re-creation of the irony war mask has an oddly ritualistic feel to it.
Yet the act is also quite erotic, for the mutual attraction between these two
battered souls is almost palpable.

  
As Sarah continues to speak, she begins to paint Ashe's face using Danny's art
supplies.

  
We see this transformation in bits and pieces - an eye here, fingers dipping
into the canister of white there, ruby lips being smeared with black...

  
...the face that is taking shape is both similar to _and_ different from
Eric's. It's the legacy of the Crow, as funneled through Ashe's own, unique
pain.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

I believe there've always been people like you...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah has finished. She sits back, surveying her work...

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

It's the pain that brings people back. It makes us strong again.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE as he turns towards us. A slash of light illuminates the
signature black and white war-paint of the Crow in all its glory. Ashe looks
like a dark saint.

Ashe rockets beneath the gothic arches of the freeway overpass on his
motorcycle, hellfire burning in his eyes, his coat flapping behind him like a
fallen angel's wings.

  
THE CROW

  
flies alongside Ashe.

  
THE CROW

  
lands on a telephone wire, studying the warehouse.

  
Presently we hear Ashe's MOTORCYCLE approaching, then we see the front wheel
of his bike pulling into the foreground.

Ashe turns to the Crow, slyly giving the bird the thumbs-up sign...

  
MATCH CUT TO...

INT. SPIDER MONKEY'S WAREHOUSE LAB - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

CA-CHUNK, CA-CHUNK, CA-CHUNK. CLOSE ON a sheet of glassine drug bags as a
hand-powered printing press comes down, mass-producing the image of the imp
giving us the thumbs up...

  
PULL BACK TO REVEAL the lab set up in a maze of barrells. The walls are
stained from the toxic fumes. Blacked-out windows sweat with moisture. There
are heating mantles rigged with flasks and condensers, vacuum pumps - along
with ingredients like battery acid, paint thinner, and Epsom salts. Nearby are
dozens of 50-gallon drums containing the finished product.

  
Spider Monkey is working away at the printing press, pausing to snoot some of
Judah's drug. Nearby is an old TV featuring lurid videos of amateur bull
riding - we watch as a drunken participant gets gored.

  
Suddenly the power in the lab goes out, the TV screen sputters and goes dark.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

Ono!

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE (O.S.)

'My mother was accursed the night she bore me and I am faint with envy of all
the dead'.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Spider Monkey whirls around, startled. Ashe is sitting cross-legged on one of
the tables, grinning like a black leather Buddha.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Tell me, Monkey. Does the corpse have a familiar face?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

Who the fuck are you?

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

You have to learn to look beyond the mask.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe jumps down from the table, walking into the light. Spider Monkey's eyes
widen in recognition.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

No way, man...we put you under...you and that little snot-nosed kid...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe dips his hand into one of the 50-gallon drums. He blows a handful of the
Trinity dust at Spider Monkey. Spider Monkey, terminally spooked, reaches back
to the counter behind him, searching for something...

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Looking for this?

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe holds up a pistol and puts it to his head.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

(an evil grin)

Don't try this at home, kids.

&nbsp_place_holder;

BOOM! ASHE

  
puts a bullet through his own forehead. His head snaps backward and his body
collapses onto the floor. Spider Monkey creeps forward toward Ashe's body...

  
ASHE

  
springs from the ground, SLAMMING Spider Monkey against a table of chemicals.
Bottles SHATTER on the floor, spilling their toxic contents.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

What are you?! What the fuck are you?!

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe leans in so he's eye to eye with Spider Monkey.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

I wasn't sure at first. Now I know. I'm the boiling man, Monkey. I'm the
plague of Darkness and the death of the first-born. All your nightmares rolled
into one.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe removes a wooden match from his inside coat pocket. He scrapes his thumb-
nail over the head, igniting it.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

Whoa...this shit's flammable! Look, look, what do you want?

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

The others. Who are they?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

Nemo. Kali. Judah. And Curve.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

I'll start with Nemo, then work my way up the food chain. Where is he?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

Nemo? Nemo's an old gash-hound. He hangs out at the Peep-O-Rama on Deacon
Street!

&nbsp_place_holder;

WHOOSH! Ashe blows the match out.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Congratulations, monkey. You just bought yourself a fighting chance.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe reaches into his coat pocket, pulling out a deck of cards. He fans them
out, points...

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Pick a card, monkey.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Spider Monkey slowly extends his hand, half-expecting Ashe to pounce on him.
He pulls a card out.

  
Spider Monkey tosses the card down, face up. He's got the Jack of Hearts. he
smiles tentatively. Ashe pulls out a card of his own and flips it around - the
King of Clubs.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Lady Luck's a bitch.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe produces another wooden match.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SPIDER MONKEY

Aw, Jesus, c'mon, man!

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

You're wasting your breath, angelito. Nobody's up there listening.

CLOSE ON MATCH

EXT. SPIDER MONKEY'S WAREHOUSE LAB - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

An EXPLOSION rips through the front of the lab, spilling roiling CLOUDS OF
FIRE out into the street. The blackened windows SHATTER OUTWARDS in a HAIL
STORM OF GLASS... ASHE

  
emerges from the raging conflagration, _walking right through the flames_,
indifferent to the heat. A flurry of the tiny glassine drug bags swirl around
him like snow.

  
THE CROW

  
spirals down from a telephone wire, landing atop the handlebars of Ashe's
motorcycle.

  
ASHE

  
lifts his head to the night sky, laughing. His clothes are still smoking.

INT. GRAY GARGOYLE - NIGHT

Sarah is working at one of the drawing tables. Noah is mixing pigments.

  
SARAH'S SKETCH PAD

  
She's working on a rendering of Ashe. She sits back...

SARAH

...and all the world will be in love with night...

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH STARES AT THE DRAWING.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SARAH

Do you believe in fate, Noah?

&nbsp_place_holder;

NOAH

(considering)

Seeems to me it's more a question of fate believing in you.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sarah rises, reaching for her bag. As she heads for the exit, Noah reaches for
the sketch. He smoothes it out, studies the image awhile as we...

&nbsp_place_holder;

The demolished building is still burning strong. Curve arrives on the scene,
dismounting his motorcycle.

  
CLOSE ON CURVE

  
as he studies the shattered glass which litters the asphalt. The fire is
reflected in the fragments. With a growing sense of dread, Curve looks from
the glass to the tattoo on his chest. He touches the Crow tattoo.

  
SCENE FROM ABOVE -

  
Now we see that the glass shards have fallen in an array that is anything but
random. _The shards have taken the shape of a large crow_.

THE CROW

  
flys past a line of palm trees which burst into flames.

INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

TWO ZIPPER-MASKED WOMEN are frolicking on a bed, acting out an elaborate
bondage fantasy. Pull back to include...

  
A VIDEO CAMERA

  
recording the pornographic act for posterity. Pull further back to include...

  
JUDAH

  
lounging on a couch a few dozen yards away, watching the women on four video
monitors, detached and twice removed from the sex play.

  
CURVE

  
enters from out of the shadows. Judah looks up to him.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

Bad news.

&nbsp_place_holder;

JUDAH

Illuminate me.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

Someone torched the lab on Manchester. Spider Monkey's a fucking crispy
critter.

&nbsp_place_holder;

JUDAH

Monkey I could care less about. What about our merchandise?

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

A total loss.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SIBYL (O.S.)

He left a sign, didn't he?

&nbsp_place_holder;

Judah looks to Sibyl who is standing nearby.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

(rising, uneasy)

I don't know what you're talking about.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SIBYL

Yes you do. You've seen it.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Sibyl points an accusing finger at Curve's chest.

&nbsp_place_holder;

SIBYL

You've been marked.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CURVE

(even more agitated)

Jesus Christ, Judah, why the fuck to you listen to her?!

&nbsp_place_holder;

JUDAH

Because she speaks the truth.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Judah rises swiftly from his chair. He snags a handful of Curve's shirt and
rips it open, revealing the Crow tattoo.

&nbsp_place_holder;

JUDAH

What's this, Curve? A beauty mark?

&nbsp_place_holder;

SIBYL

Your enemy wears the mask of the Crow. The bird of ill-omen.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CLOSE ON Judah as the words sink in. He strides across the floor, sweeping
aside one of the curtains surrounding the camera obscura.

&nbsp_place_holder;

JUDAH

The Crow. Death's avatar. I've heard the legends.

&nbsp_place_holder;

JUDAH

  
looks down at a view of the seething landscape.

&nbsp_place_holder;

JUDAH

Let him come, then.

CUT TO:

EXT. PEEP-O-RAMA PORN SHOP - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

The Peep-O-Rama occupies an old Japanese movie house. A geisha-girl sign
flashes over the marquee. Beneath that is a blinking neon eye which opens and
closes. Other signs offer enticements like "ONLY 25 CENTS A PEEP!" and "REAL
GIRLS WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE!"

  
As Nemo approaches, a laconic HINDU with a throat microphone sits outside,
reciting his tired schpiel.

&nbsp_place_holder;

HINDU

Tokens for the buddy booths, live girls. Tokens for the buddy booths, live
girls...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Nemo hands the Hindu a twenty.

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. BUDDY BOOTH - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Nemo enters a cramped booth, clutching a handful of tokens embossed with the
Peep-O-Rama eye logo on them. There's a seat, a box of Kleenex, a phone, and a
grimy Plexiglas window with a metal shutter over it.

  
Nemo starts popping tokens into the slot next to the window, pockets the rest
of them.

  
With a WHIR the metal shutter rises, revealing a WOMAN in a garter-belt get-up
perched on a stool. In a forgiving light, she might even be beautiful.

  
An LED display starts counting down from sixty - the seconds remaining on the
metered shutter. Nemo picks up the receiver.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO

You got a name?

&nbsp_place_holder;

WOMAN

Holly Daze. Do you want me, baby?

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO

I need to see some sugar.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Holly shrugs out of her bra, plants her scuffed-up high heels on either side
of the window, runs her hands up and down her body, utters some tired-ass
MOANS.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO

Right on, sister...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Nemo unbuckles his belt, drops his drawers...

&nbsp_place_holder;

HOLLY

(eyeing his endowment)

Mmmm. Is that for me?

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO

Yeah, we're gonna celebrate Christmas a little early this year.

&nbsp_place_holder;

HOLLY

Keep doing that, honey, you'll go blind.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CUT TO:

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. PEEP-O-RAMA BUDDY BOOTH - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Holly is still MOANING. Over on the LED display, Nemo's time has just about
expired.

&nbsp_place_holder;

HOLLY

Time's almost up, lover. Better hurry up with those tokens.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO

Shitfire...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Nemo fumbles with his pants, scoops out some more tokens...

  
Too late, the shutter is already closing. Nemo feeds some more tokens into the
slot. Nothing happens. Nemo punches the LED display.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO

Come on, fucker!

&nbsp_place_holder;

The shutter starts rattling up again, only this time...

  
ASHE

  
_is standing on the other side of the Plexiglas_. His mouth splits into an
evil grin.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

"Do you want me, baby?"

&nbsp_place_holder;

Nemo's eyes just about pop from his skull.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO

_You_.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

_Me_.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CRASH! Ashe slams his fists through the Plexiglas window, reaching for Nemo's
throat.

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. PEEP-O-RAMA, HALLWAY - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Nemo comes flying out the booth door. He struggles to rise. A CHORUS OF
ORGASMIC SIGHS and cheesy SURF MUSIC drifts out from the other booths.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ZEKE

(o.s.)

Hey, mime boy.

&nbsp_place_holder;

AT THE FRONT COUNTER.

  
ZEKE, the Peep-O-Rama's corpulent manager, is cradling a sawed-off shotgun.
BOOM! _He blows a blast into Ashe's chest!_

  
Ashe starts toward Zeke, unfazed. Zeke moves to fire again...

  
Ashe snatches the shotgun from the fat man's grasp, smashing him in the face
with the butt-end. Zeke falls back into a video display, sending an avalanche
of porno tapes raining down on top of him.

  
Seizing the moment, Nemo rushes for the exit...

  
Ashe spins, pumps the shotgun, _blows out one of Nemo's kneecaps_. Nemo
collapses on the floor, wailing like a child. Ashe strides over to him.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

One crow sorrow...

&nbsp_place_holder;

He HEAVES Nemo through a glass display booth filled with sex toys. Ashe
punctuates each line of the nursery rhyme with a new assault on Nemo.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

...two crows joy...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Nemo starts dragging his broken body across the floor. He finds himself face
to face with an anatomically-correct blow-up sex doll - the kind with a built-
in pre-recorded memory chip.

&nbsp_place_holder;

DOLL

_Ooh, oh baby, I like it like that. You're so good. You're so good..._

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Three crows a letter, four crows a boy...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe HEAVES Nemo back the other way, sending him SMASHING into the front
counter. Peep-O-Rama tokens go flying, bouncing and spinning every which
way...

  
CLOSE ON A SPINNING TOKEN

  
On one side of the coin the eye is open, on the other it's closed - this
creates the illusion of the eye blinking.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Five crows silver, six crows gold...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Nemo utters a half-sob and rolls over, feebly wiping away the blood which is
clouding his eyes.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

Seven crows a secret never to be told.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO

...please, please just stop...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe pries open Nemo's eyes with his fingers.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

You killed my son, Nemo. You took away the only piece of light left in my
soul.

&nbsp_place_holder;

NEMO

We had to! Judah's orders. Never leave any witnesses! We didn't have a choice!

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

We always have a choice.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe plunges his fingers into Nemo's eyes - killing him off-camera. He lifts
up his now blood-covered hands and turns...

  
Just then, Holly Daze bursts out into the hall. She sees Ashe and YELPS,
certain her number's up. Ashe grabs her by the wrist, spinning her around.

&nbsp_place_holder;

HOLLY DAZE

(cringing)

...no...

&nbsp_place_holder;

Ashe touches her face and sees a split-second FLASH of...

  
HOLLY DAZE DANCING

  
Jump-cut bump and grind, CAT-CALLS, LAUGHTER, the distorted faces of men
leering with their hungry eyes, tongues and sweaty palms and heavy breath and
I wanna be your fucking dog, baby, and...

  
BANG! ASHE

  
shuts his eyes, reeling...

  
Ashe looks up at Holly - one victim to another. His eyes burn a laser beam
into her soul.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE

If you value what you've lost, you'll walk away from this place and never look
back.

&nbsp_place_holder;

Holly Daze nods with conviction. Ashe releases her. She bolts like a rabbit
flushed from cover.

  
CUT TO:

EXT. PEEP-O-RAMA - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Curve ROARS UP on his motorcycle, followed by Kali and a car-load of
ENFORCERS. The team grab their weapons, head for the porno shop...

&nbsp_place_holder;

KALI

Inside!

&nbsp_place_holder;

Kali leads the crew of killers into the porno shop. But Curve stops, sensing
something. He spins around...

  
THE CROW

  
is sitting atop one of the cars, watching him.

&nbsp_place_holder;

INT. PEEP-O-RAMA, BACK CORRIDOR - NIGHT

&nbsp_place_holder;

Kali and Curve move down the dark corridor. The PORN ACTRESS VOICES from the
vid-booths continue their ORGIASTIC MOANS, but one voice in particular stand
out.

&nbsp_place_holder;

KALI

Nemo?

&nbsp_place_holder;

DOLL'S VOICE

_Ooh, oh baby, you're so good..._

&nbsp_place_holder;

CAMERA FINDS NEMO'S BODY

  
at the end of the corridor, lounging in the arms of the sex doll which is
still repeating its tinny refrain. Nemo's neck has been snapped and his head
hangs at an awkward angle.

&nbsp_place_holder;

DOLL

_...oh! Oh yea, that's the spot. Do me, baby. Do me._

&nbsp_place_holder;

There's a folded piece of paper shoved into Nemo's mouth. Curve pries it out.
The paper unfolds like one of those snowflake cut-outs we used to make in
grade school - _only this cut-out is of a crow_.

  
Written across the paper crow are the following words:

  

" I KNOW WHY JESUS WEPT"

&nbsp_place_holder;

A phone on the wall is RINGING. RINGING and RINGING. Finally, Curve leans in,
snatches up he receiver...

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE'S VOICE

Do you know what they call a gathering of crows, Curve?

&nbsp_place_holder;

At the sound of Ashe's voice, Curve's eyes widen with fear.

&nbsp_place_holder;

ASHE'S VOICE

A murder. A murder of crows. Think about it.

&nbsp_place_holder;

CLICK! The line goes dead. Furious, Curve tears the phone from the wall,
HEAVING it across the porno shop.
