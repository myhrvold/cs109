               1   EXT. OFF COAST OF ANTIGUA, 1775 (BLACK & WHITE) - DAY          1   
    
                   SUPER: "ANTIGUA, 1775" 
    
                   A dinghy filled with five grizzled pirates rowing through 
                   rough waters.  Two passengers, cleaner than the rest, sit in 
                   the middle looking around quite nervously.
    
                                         PASSENGER#1
                             Ah... maybe this wasn't a good idea.  
                             I think that I...
    
                                         PIRATE#1
                             Ah, ne'r ye mind.  Capn's always 
                             lookin' fer fresh meat.  Er, new 
                             blood.
    
                   One of the other pirates grabs his shoulder, making him jump.
    
                                         PIRATE#2
                             Yeah... 'sides, who wouldn't wanna' 
                             be parta' the fiercest crew afloat?  
                             Hmm?
    
                   Laughs.  The small rowboat pulls up next to a large, fully 
                   armored and decorated pirate ship.  The INFERNO.  It is 
                   anchored closely to a strange, circular reef.  A rope ladder 
                   is thrown over the port side for them to board ship.  Lots 
                   of activity.  Two or three men are standing down on the reef.  
                   A pirate slaps one of the passengers' butts as he climbs up.  
                   The other is poked with a sword to hurry him up the ladder.
    
                                         PIRATE#1
                             Don' fall... wouldn't want ye ta 
                             feed the sharks a'for meetin the 
                             cap'n.
    
                                         PASSENGER#2
                             Sh-sharks?
    
                   The men climb aboard and join the group on deck near the 
                   mainmast.  Various remarks and catcalls mock the passengers 
                   until everyone suddenly quiets down and looks toward the 
                   captain's galley door.  It creaks open.  Out of the shadows, 
                   a burly figure steps forth.  We only see him from the right 
                   side.  There is a slight limp to his walk as he makes his 
                   way to the center of the group.  He stops almost face to 
                   face with the passengers.
    
                                         WILLY
                             Welcome aboard the Inferno.
                                                                            2.
                   In an instant, we see his left side... and the decorated 
                   patch covering his left eye.  ONE-EYED WILLY.  He is in his 
                   mid-30's and doesn't look like your typical idea of a pirate 
                   except for the eye patch.  He is clean-shaven and speaks 
                   very well.
    
                                         WILLY (CONT'D)
                             I hear that you wish to become 
                             pirates.  
                                  (He cracks a smile)
                             That true?
    
                                         PASSENGER#1
                             Yes... We do, sir.
    
                                         WILLY
                             Fine.  Then pirates you are.  Just 
                             not aboard _this_ ship until you 
                             accomplish one thing.  
    
                                         PASSENGER#1
                             J-just _one_ thing?  What "thing"?
    
                                         WILLY
                             The Gauntlet.
    
                   The crew gives a deep moan, almost in unison.  Some laugh. 
    
                                         PASSENGER#2
                             What is the "gauntlet"?
    
                                         WILLY
                             Oh... nothing really.  Just a test.
    
                   Two huge Samoan-looking pirates grab the passengers roughly 
                   from behind.  Others begin tying ropes around their wrists.
    
                                         WILLY (CONT'D)
                             A simple test to see if you have 
                             what it takes to become a member of 
                             my elite crew of "ruthless 
                             barbarians".  All you have to do is 
                             retrieve a sword for me.  That's it.
    
                   The pirates drag the frightened passengers towards the bow 
                   of the ship, tying them to the wooden point in front.  They 
                   toss them over the front so they are hanging upside-down by 
                   their ankles -- just above and to each side of the carved 
                   wooden lady that adorns the bow of the ship.  
    
                                         WILLY (CONT'D)
                             Unfortunately for you two, the weapons 
                             are located BENEATH the Inferno.
                             Attached to the centermost point of 
                             her lovely hull are your keys back 
                             onto the ship.  One for each of you.  
                             Bring them to me, and you shall reap 
                             the benefits of all that I have to 
                             offer.
    
                   Two pirates carry over a large barrel and dump it overboard 
                   beneath the passengers.  It is filled with bloody remains, 
                   and quickly turns the water red.
    
                                         WILLY (CONT'D)
                             Oh.  There is a rope ladder at the 
                             stern of the ship.  If you still 
                             have an arm left by then, please 
                             feel free to use it.
    
                   A shark fin pops out of the water below the men.  The water 
                   starts to churn rapidly as several sharks vie for the chum.  
                   It appears that they have been here for a while.  The pirates 
                   aboard ship begin to howl and place bets.  Willy grins.  The 
                   two passengers begin to scream as their ropes are cut from 
                   the ship.  Passenger#1 is cut free first and lands roughly 
                   on top of one of the sharks.  His hands are still tied 
                   loosely.  He is desperately trying to free himself as 
                   Passenger#2 splashes down beside him.  Sharks are everywhere.  
                   Another barrel of chum is dumped on top of them.  Passenger#2, 
                   covered in blood, reddish water, and meat chunks... gives a 
                   brief terrified look at Passenger#1, but doesn't help him.  
                   He takes a deep breath, then dives amid the sharks and starts 
                   under the ship.  Passenger#1 frees himself, then breathes 
                   deeply and dives under.
    
                   UNDERWATER
    
                   The water is very clear, and it is easy to see that the water 
                   is alive with sharks.  Passenger#2 leads by about two body 
                   lengths.  As passenger#1 starts off, a shark attacks him, 
                   slicing into his leg.  Passenger#1 twists around to see the 
                   beast gripping his leg and kicks roughly at the shark with 
                   everything he has.  Another sharks brushes by his side.  His 
                   heel connects with the eye of the shark, and he is released.  
                   He spastically swims away with a trail of blood flowing from 
                   the severe wound.  Passenger#2 has reached the center of the 
                   ship where two swords are mounted in a small receded area 
                   about four feet from each other on either side of the keel.  
                   He reaches up and grabs the handle of the closest one.  As 
                   quickly as he grabs it, two panels spring into place on each 
                   side of his wrist... locking his arm inside.  He begins 
                   panicking, wildly trying to get his wrist free.  Passenger#1 
                   swims up seeing the other sword, then the trapped passenger.  
                   He swims over to Passenger#2 and tries to help him.  Nothing.  
                   He twists around and sees a very large shark heading toward 
                   them.  He quickly pushes away and goes to the other sword.
                   Instead of grabbing it, he kicks at it.  The sword falls out 
                   as the panels slide quickly into place, trapping nothing 
                   besides water this time.  He almost misses catching the sword 
                   before it plunges into the depths.  He turns back to 
                   Passenger#2.  Only an arm hangs from the trapped panel now.  
                   A small trail of blood leads away from the limb.  He lets 
                   out what remaining air that he has and swims up to the port 
                   side of the ship.
    
                   Bursting through the surface of the water, he gasps loudly 
                   for air.  He is only a few feet from the reef.  The pirates 
                   scream in support.  He swims rapidly to the reef, trying to 
                   climb up.  A shark swims by.  The four pirates on the reef 
                   quickly push him back into the water!
    
                                         PIRATE#3
                             Uh-uh!  Ye ain't finished yet... ye 
                             gotta' get ta' the ship!
    
                   With his leg trailing a lot of blood, he swims rapidly towards 
                   the stern of the ship.  A shark bumps him as he rounds the 
                   aft of the Inferno.  A rope ladder is mounted to the stern.  
                   The pirates are staring down at him, screaming in support.  
                   Exhausted, he fumbles for the rungs.
    
                                         PIRATE#1
                             Ye better jump, flea!
    
                   The pirate points behind Passenger#1.  A shark fin is speeding 
                   towards him.  He quickly tries to climb the ladder, but he 
                   is tired, has a sword in one hand, and his wounded leg isn't 
                   working very well.  Just as the shark is about to bear down 
                   on him, he is pulled up with the ladder by the group of 
                   pirates.  They cheer loudly as they grasp his wet clothes 
                   and pull him aboard.  He collapses onto the deck, bleeding 
                   and breathing heavily.  Willy steps up to him.
    
                                         WILLY
                             Well, men... it appears that we have 
                             a new shipmate!
    
                   Cheers.  Passenger#1 weakly raises his sword into the air.  
                   Willy reaches down, pulling him to his feet.  He stumbles.
    
                                         WILLY (CONT'D)
                             Someone attend to his leg!  We don't 
                             need another damn peg leg aboard!
    
                   A pirate with a bone peg leg hurries forward with bandages 
                   and starts to work on Passenger#1's wound. 
    
                                         PASSENGER#1
                                  (weakly)
                             How many have...
                                                                           5.
                                         WILLY
                             Huh?  Speak up, mate!
    
                                         PASSENGER#1
                             How... How many have made it though 
                             that alive? 
    
                                         WILLY
                             None!  You are the first, Matey.  
                             Not too easy, was it?
    
                   A lot of shouting and pointing.  A small dinghy has made its 
                   way to the ship.  A man hurriedly climbs aboard and heads 
                   directly toward Willy.  He is out of breath and sighs deeply 
                   before speaking.
    
                                         MESSENGER
                             They 're almost upon us.  A ship 
                             just pulled into port and said they 
                             passed 'em on the way in.  A DAY'S 
                             travel!  THEY ARE ALMOST HERE!  
    
                                         PIRATE#1
                             Ye said we had _weeks_, Cap'n!
    
                   There is much excitement on board.  Everyone has turned to 
                   face Willy as if expecting answers that he doesn't have.
    
                                         PIRATE#2
                             Yeah!  Wha' happened?  We...
    
                                         WILLY
                             ENOUGH!  The English have gained on 
                             us sooner than I had planned, but 
                             all is not yet lost.
                                  (He motions toward 
                                  the side of the ship 
                                  where the reef is)
                             Close it up... NOW!  We are leaving!
    
                                         PIRATE#1
                             But Cap'n... there are MEN down there!
    
                                         WILLY
                             I don't care!  Let God worry about 
                             them -- Not me.
    
                   Willy smiles at the new passenger, then turns and heads back 
                   to his quarters.
    
                                         WILLY (CONT'D)
                             And get that man a change of clothes.  
                             He's a welcome addition to the crew!
    
                   He slams the door shut behind him.
    
    
    
               2   EXT. - INFERNO - NIGHT                                         2   
    
                   The ship crashes through the waves.  Windswept pirates cover 
                   the deck, rushing to and fro.  Standing on the poop deck, 
                   Willy stares into the night behind them through a spy glass.  
                   A single light can barely be seen on the horizon.
    
                                         PIRATE#2
                             Cap'n?  Anything?
    
                                         WILLY
                             Yes.
    
                   Time passes.  Various images of a very long and rough trip.  
                   The English ship is much faster and is gaining.  There is a 
                   firefight.  The Inferno is outgunned.  Damaged, they try to 
                   flee.  The English ship follows.
    
               3   EXT. INFERNO - DAY                                             3   
    
                   Willy is staring back at the very close ship.  He looks down 
                   at a crude map.  A pirate comes running up to him, breathless.
    
                                         PIRATE#1
                             Cap'n!  They says there's a cave 
                             aroun' the bend a bit!  Can barely 
                             be seen from the nest...
    
                   He motions up to crow's nest perched on the masthead.
    
                                         WILLY
                             And?
    
                                         PIRATE#1
                             We was thinkin' that we could pull 
                             the Inferno inside.  You know, so...
    
                                         WILLY
                             Big enough for her, eh?  Hmmm.  If 
                             they pass by, we can swing around 
                             behind her...
                                  (pauses)
                             Aye.  DO IT!  NOW!
    
                   An Instant flurry of action begins aboard the Inferno.
    
                                         WILLY (CONT'D)
                             Cut her as close to the shore as ye 
                             can!  We need to make it in before 
                             they can see around the bend!  MOVE, 
                             fer God's sake, MOVE!  Man the hand 
                             lead and lines!
    
                                                                             7.
               4   INT. CAVE ABOARD THE INFERNO - DARKNESS                        4   
    
                   Pirates crouch in the shadows peering out between the gunwale.  
                   The Inferno is tucked silently within the darkened walls of 
                   a VERY large cave.  The men watch silently as the trailing 
                   ship rounds the bend outside the cave about 1000 yards out 
                   at sea.  It continues without slowing.  The men aboard the 
                   Inferno begin to smile.  
    
                   Suddenly, the smiling stops.  The ship starts to turn towards 
                   them.  It is obvious that they have been seen.  The crew 
                   starts scurrying to their posts.  They are trapped.  The 
                   ship outside moves into place and starts firing towards the 
                   cave.  Gradually, the cannons begin to find targets.  The 
                   cave starts to collapse around the Inferno.  Willy stands at 
                   the stern of his ship... shadows of the collapsing cave dance 
                   across his hardened face until all that is left is darkness.
    
                                                                        CUT TO:
    
               5   INT. - ONE-EYED WILLY'S HOUSE O' ANTIQUES - DAY                5   
    
                   BEGIN CREDITS.
    
                   During the credits, we are privy to the many objects of 
                   curiosity lining the walls of the shop.  There is a framed 
                   yellowed newspaper article about the discovery of an 
                   empty pirate ship off the coast of Hawaii, and another 
                   on the arrest of the Fratelli family thanks to a group 
                   of kids from the Goon docks.  Somewhere among the articles 
                   we even catch a glimpse of the map & doubloon that led 
                   to the original adventure.  At the end of the credits 
                   there is a framed photo of the original group of Goonies 
                   huddled together: MIKEY, BRAND, CHUNK, DATA, MOUTH, ANDY, 
                   & STEF.
    
                   END CREDITS. 
    
                   A hand reaches down and grasps an inhaler next to the 
                   cash register.  MIKEY inhales deeply, then begins to 
                   breathe normally.  He is now in his mid 20's, but will 
                   never appear to be his true age.  The front door of the 
                   shop creaks open, accompanied by the sound of the 
                   connected chimes.  Mikey looks up from the dusty book 
                   that he is reading to see an elderly man, CHESTER 
                   COPPERPOT III, enter the store.  He is in his fifties, 
                   and is obviously well-to-do.  The door slowly closes 
                   behind him as he steps toward the front counter, staring 
                   off distantly.  Mikey straightens himself up a bit.
    
                                         MIKEY
                        Good afternoon, Sir.
    
                   The man seems to ignore him.  He turns, appearing to be 
                   looking for something.
                   He walks briskly toward the display case containing the 
                   MEDALLION & SKELETON KEY from the first film.  He brushes 
                   his fingers gently across the top... almost caressing 
                   the glass.  Mikey comes out from behind the counter as 
                   the man attempts to open the case.
    
                                         MIKEY (CONT'D)
                        Uh, Sir that is not for sale.  It's 
                        only a display...
    
                                         CHESTER
                             Twenty-Five thousand.
    
                   Mikey stumbles a bit.
    
                                         MIKEY
                             Excuse me?
    
                                         CHESTER
                             Twenty-Five thousand.  Cash.
    
                                         MIKEY
                             F-For those...?
    
                                         CHESTER
                                  (Slowly. Pronounced.)
                             Each.
    
                   The man has not yet looked at Mikey.  Suddenly, the door 
                   swings open behind them.  TAMI enters the store.  She is 
                   about the same age as Mikey, and obviously knows him 
                   quite well.
    
                                         TAMI
                             Hi, Babe...
                                  (spotting the 
                                  customer)
                             Oh, sorry.
    
                   She quietly goes behind the counter.  Mikey slowly turns 
                   back to Chester nervously.
    
                                         MIKEY
                             I, uh, can't.  Did you say... 
                             "Each"?
    
                                         CHESTER
                                  (Finally looks up 
                                  at Mikey)
                             I will pay you fifty thousand 
                             dollars cash for these two pieces.
    
                   Tami's attention is instantly hooked by his words.
                                                                           9.
                                         MIKEY
                             No.  No, I can't.  They're special -- 
                             we went though a lot together.
    
                   Tami moves in from around the counter.
    
                                         TAMI
                             Mike...
    
                                         CHESTER
                             Mr. Walsh, EVERYTHING has a price.  
                             What do you need from me to make 
                             us BOTH happy?  Just say a number.
    
                                         TAMI
                             Mikey...
    
                                         MIKEY
                             No.  I'm sorry, they are not for 
                             sale.
    
                   Mikey turns from him, and heads back to the counter.  
                   Chester stands there for a moment before heading for the 
                   door.  He is obviously annoyed.  Tami trails after him.
    
                                         TAMI
                             Uh, Mr... let me talk to him.  
                             He's just...
    
                   They both exit to the street.  Through the window we can 
                   see them talking.  He hands her something, then goes to 
                   his car.  She returns inside.
    
                                         TAMI (CONT'D)
                             Mikey, do you realize what we 
                             could do with that money?  We...
    
                                         MIKEY
                             Yes, Tam.  I know.
                                  (takes a deep breath 
                                  from the inhaler.)
                             Those aren't really mine to sell.  
                             They were a gift from a VERY old 
                             friend. 
    
                   Tami stares, her face very slowly changing from confusion 
                   to love.  She moves forward, gently touching his face.
    
                                         TAMI
                             You know that they have treatments 
                             for obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
                             right?
                                  (pauses with a smile)
                             Ok, Mr.  You win.
                             You get to keep your trinkets.  
                             We can squalor in poverty for 
                             now.
    
                   They embrace.  Behind him, she tosses the BUSINESS CARD 
                   that Chester handed her onto the counter.  It lands face 
                   down.
    
          6   T. INT. - OREGON STATE PRISON -- EVENING                            6   
    
                   An INMATE lazily rolls a cart covered in books, magazines, 
                   and newspapers down the row of prison cells.  He hands a 
                   few books through the bars of a couple cells.  At one, 
                   we see a HAND poke out with two packs of cigarettes.  He 
                   takes them, giving a sly glance around -- then reaches 
                   under the stack of magazines and gives the hand a copy 
                   of PLAYBOY.  He wheels up to the next cell and stops.  
                   JAKE FRATELLI is laying on his cot.  He looks up at the 
                   INMATE and gives a crooked smile.
    
                                         JAKE
                             Whatcha' got, Buzz?  Any hacksaws 
                             today?
    
                                         INMATE
                             Yeah, but I just gave the last 
                             one away to someone who knows how 
                             to use it.
    
                                         JAKE
                             Oh, that hurt.  Just gimme' my 
                             paper.
    
                   The INMATE takes the top newspaper, and begins to pass 
                   it through the bars.  GUARD1 steps up and swipes it from 
                   his hand before JAKE takes it.  The INMATE looks at the 
                   guard, then pushes his cart forward to the next cell.
    
                                         GUARD1
                             What the hell's this shit?
                                  (reading the paper)
                             The "Astoria Times Delta"?  How 
                             cute... Why do YOU care what goes 
                             on in Astoria -- ain't like you're 
                             ever gonna' go back, Jake.
    
                   JAKE stands up, pressing his face against the bars.
    
                                         JAKE
                             I like to read the obituaries... 
                             hoping I might find someone I know.
    
                                         GUARD1
                             Oh, yeah... ain't that the section 
                             where I found your mother's picture?  
                             Geez, you'd think she could at least 
                             crack a smile.
    
                   Jake's eyes widen, furious.  He swings his arms out between 
                   the bars, trying to grab the guard.
    
                                         JAKE
                             You son-of-a-bitch!  I'll get YOUR 
                             damn picture in the paper... she 
                             died in PRISON.  I didn't even get a  
                             chance to see her!
    
                   The guard backs away quickly, laughing as he smacks at Jake's 
                   hand with the rolled up newspaper.  He tosses the paper to 
                   the floor near the cell.
    
                                         GUARD1
                             Kill a federal agent, and you deserve 
                             to die in the CHAIR.  Not a prison 
                             cell.  She got lucky.  Tell your 
                             brother I send my regards.  I heard 
                             he's been raked over so many times 
                             now that he's gotta' wear Diapers.
    
                   The guard heads off with a smirk.  Slowly, Jake reaches down 
                   and picks up the paper without lifting his eyes off the guard.  
                   He mumbles to himself as he lies down on his bunk to read 
                   the paper.
    
                                                                       CUT TO:

                   A MAILMAN opens the mailbox located outside DATA'S house, 
                   and inserts a few pieces of mail.  Along the side of the 
                   mailbox are the words, "RICK WANG".  As soon as the door is 
                   closed, a light activates on the front of the box.  The 
                   mailman shakes his head and walks off.  The mailbox starts 
                   to tilt at an odd upward angle until all of the mail slides 
                   back into the clear chute that serves as the post the box 
                   sits on.  It disappears underground.
    
               8   INT. DATA'S HOUSE - DAY                                        8   
    
                   Inside, the mail shoots out of a tube onto a strange sorting 
                   machine.  It takes each piece of mail individually, opening 
                   the side with a sharp letter opener.  A tweezer-like arm 
                   separates the sides of the envelope and removes the letters 
                   from inside.  One particular letter looks as if it is written 
                   on old parchment paper.  The armature moves this letter over 
                   to the adjoining computer and slides it into a flatbed 
                   scanner.
                   The monitor next to it begins displaying the full screen 
                   image as it is scanned into the system:
    
                   "Ye are invited to the wedding of Michael "Mikey" Walsh and 
                   Tami Lynn Springmeyer"
    
                   It is a fancy wedding invitation made up to look like a 
                   treasure map.  There is a big red "X" over Astoria, Oregon.  
                   The modem starts dialing out.
    
               9   INT. KATTEL TOYS, DATA'S OFFICE - DAY                          9   
    
                   DATA, now in his late 20's, is seated at his computer.  He 
                   is the lead toy designer for Kattel Toys.  Various posters 
                   and items he's created decorate his wild office.  A poster 
                   for "Slick Shoes" hangs behind him.  A VOICE comes across 
                   his computer speakers.
    
                                         VOICE
                             You've got mail.
    
                   Data leans forward and clicks on an icon.  The Wedding 
                   invitation appears on his screen -- instantly scanned and 
                   mailed from home.  As he reads, a smile forms.
    
                                         DATA
                             All Right!  He's gettin' married!

                   STEF sits at her sculpting wheel, hands covered in wet clay.  
                   In one hand, she has the wedding invitation.  Her eyes are 
                   wide with excitement as she hurriedly pushes the buttons on 
                   the phone to dial out.  It rings.  MOUTH answers on the other 
                   end.

                             you sure, Babe?
    
                                         STEF
                             Of course I'm sure, Dork.  Why would 
                             I say that if I wasn't sure?  I have 
                             the invitation right here!

                             I _love_ when you call me names, Stef.

                   He is on his Cellular phone, and surrounded by election signs 
                   covered with his name and picture.  He is running for public 
                   office.  A lady walks up and shakes his hand while he is on 
                   the phone.
    
                                         MOUTH (CONT'D)
                             When's the wedding?
    
                                         STEF (O.S.)
                             You have to wait until you get HOME 
                             to find out.  Soon I hope?
    
                                         MOUTH
                             You wanna' get all "Demi Moore" with 
                             the clay again?
                                  (chuckles)
                             I should be home in a bit, Stef
                                  (pause)
                             Yeah, I love you too.
    
                   He hangs up the phone and smiles at a few of the people 
                   passing by.  He hands out a few election buttons.
    
                                         MOUTH (CONT'D)
                             Wow... Mikey.  Married.
    
              12   INT. CHUNK'S UC BERKELEY DORM - DAY                           12   
    
                   A student wearing a Berkeley T-shirt walks down the dorm 
                   hallway waving a letter above his head.  He yells down the 
                   hallway.
    
                                         STUDENT
                             Lawrence!  You got a letter here... 
                             looks kind of strange.  LAWRENCE!
    
                   CHUNK pokes his head out of his room.  He is no longer 
                   overweight, and actually looks quite serious now.
    
                                         CHUNK
                             Yeah?  What is it?
    
                                         STUDENT
                             Weird, man.  Looks like an invitation 
                             or something.
    
                   He tosses the old-parchment envelope at Chunk.
    
                                         STUDENT (CONT'D)
                             What the hell does "Chunk" mean?
    
                   Chunk stares down at the envelope.  "Lawrence 'Chunk' Cohen" 
                   is written in decorative calligraphy on the front.  Dazed, 
                   he backs quickly into his dorm room and shuts the door.  He 
                   rips open the envelope and pulls out the invitation.
                   As he reads it, his face lights up.  He starts to scream in 
                   excitement.  The student in the hallway hears this, then 
                   walks away shaking his head.
    
                                         STUDENT (CONT'D)
                                  (to himself)
                             What a freak.
    
              13   INT. LUMBER MILL, ASTORIA, OREGON, DAY                        13   
    
                   Extremely dirty from work, BRAND is standing reading though 
                   the invitation.  People are working all around him.  Saws, 
                   forklifts, etc.  By the look on his face, this is his first 
                   time reading the letter.  He looks ecstatic.
    
                                         BRAND
                             Hey, everyone!  My brothers getting 
                             married!
    
                   Through all the noise, a few guys look over confused.  Not 
                   sure what he said.
    
                                         WORKER#1
                             "You lover's getting carried?"  What 
                             the hell does THAT mean, Brand?
    
                                         BRAND
                             No... My...
    
                   He waves for a few of the machines to stop.
    
                                         BRAND (CONT'D)
                             My BROTHER'S getting MARRIED!
    
                   There is an awkward pause.
    
                                         WORKER#2
                             And you're _happy_?
    
                                         WORKER#1
                             Poor bastard.
    
                   The machines start back up, and everyone goes back to work.  
                   One worker walks past brand and pats his back.
    
                                         WORKER#3
                             Sorry, Bud.  Better him than you.
    
                   Brand is oblivious to them, and walks off smiling.
    
              14   INT. PRESCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY                                14   
    
                   ANDY is on the phone at the back of the classroom.  Children 
                   are playing loudly throughout the room.  A few are finger 
                   painting near the front.
    
                                         ANDY
                             Are you sure?
    
                                         STEF (O.S.)
                             What is it with you people?  Chunk 
                             was the one who made up stories... 
                             not me.  Of course I am sure.  I 
                             have the invitation right here.
    
                                         ANDY
                             Wow.  It almost feels surreal.  What's 
                             her name?
    
                                         STEF (O.S.)
                             Tami.  Cute.  I didn't even know he 
                             was dating anyone.
    
                                         ANDY
                             Do you... do you think Brand will be 
                             there?
    
                                         STEF (O.S.)
                             Duh.  It's his brother.  Of course 
                             he will be there.  Why?  Uh-Oh... A 
                             coal still burning in the fire?  I 
                             thought you were living with that 
                             prissy model guy, Jason.
    
                                         ANDY
                             Well... It's a long story.  He was 
                             just the short version of it.  
                             Everyone seems so... Boring.
    
                   One of the kids purposely steps on a plastic squirt bottle 
                   of blue paint.  It sprays all over one of the other kids, 
                   and the chalkboard behind.  Screaming.
    
                                         ANDY (CONT'D)
                             Oh, crap.  Gotta' go, Stef.
    
                                         STEF (O.S.)
                             Call me...
    
                                         ANDY
                             I will!
    
                   She hangs up, and heads over to the newly created mess.
    
                                                                        CUT TO:
    
              15   INT. OREGON STATE PRISON -- NIGHT                             15   
    
                   Feet clicking down the darkened hallway.  Two prison guards 
                   stop in front of JAKE'S cell.  The door slides open.  Jake 
                   is asleep in his rack.  Guard1 steps inside, quietly.
                   The other one stands outside of the cell.
    
                                         GUARD1
                             Pssst.  Hey, Dirtbag.
    
                   Jake quickly wakes up, scared.
    
                                         JAKE
                             Yeah, yeah?  Who... the hell?
                                  (realizing who it is)
                             I didn't do nothin'!  I --
    
                                         GUARD1
                             Get up, you're coming with us.  Now.
    
                   Jakes looks around quickly.  Something isn't right.  He looks 
                   worried.
    
                                         JAKE
                             Look, Man.  I'm OK with you sayin' 
                             crap about my Mom.  Say whatever you 
                             want --
    
                                         GUARD1
                             Shut the Hell up, Jake.  You have 30 
                             seconds, or I am going to walk out 
                             of here without you.
    
                   Jake looks up confused.
    
                                         JAKE
                             So... all I have to do is lay here 
                             and you'll leave?
    
                                         GUARD1
                             You don't WANT me to leave without 
                             you.  Trust me.
    
                   Jake slowly starts to get out of bed.  He reaches over for 
                   his pants and starts to put them on while still eyeing the 
                   guards suspiciously.  The three of them start to head back 
                   down the corridor of cells.
    
                                         JAKE
                             What's this about?
    
                                         GUARD1
                             The warden wants to see you.
    
                                         JAKE
                             In the middle of the night?  Gimme' 
                             a break.  You guys planing on shooting 
                             me?  Saying that I was trying to 
                             escape --
    
                                         GUARD2
                             Jeezus.  Are you for real?
    
                                         JAKE
                             I've seen the movies.  You guys always 
                             pull that kind of shit.
    
                                         GUARD1
                             Oh, and by that theory... all 
                             prisoners are actually innocent, 
                             right?
    
                   Both guards give a slight chuckle.  Jake looks around 
                   nervously as they pass through a few open doors.  They enter 
                   a large darkened room.  Someone is seated at the desk hidden 
                   by shadows.
    
                                         GUARD1 (CONT'D)
                             Need one of us to stay with you?
    
                   From the shadows.
    
                                         WARDEN
                             That will not be needed.  Go about 
                             your business and have a good night.
    
                                         GUARD1
                             You need us to check back in?  To 
                             take this scumbag back to his...
    
                                         WARDEN
                             No.
    
                   The guard looks confused.  He shrugs his shoulders, then the 
                   two guards exit the room.  The door closes behind them.  
                   There is an awkward silence.
    
                                         JAKE
                             Uh, Warden.  I ain't been causin' no 
                             problems, Sir.
    
                                         WARDEN
                             Mr. Fratelli.
    
                                         JAKE
                             ...and I'm actually kinda tired too.
                                  (fakes a yawn)
                             Gotta' get ready for my parole board 
                             hearing next Thursday.
    
                                         WARDEN
                             Jake.  There isn't going to BE a 
                             parole hearing.
    
                   Jake looks stunned.  The door suddenly swings open behind 
                   him, making him jump.  There is a ruckus as three men enter.
    
                                         FRANCIS
                             I...I didn't do anything!  Come on, 
                             guys.  Jus' let me go back to my 
                             cell.  Please?  PLEASE?
    
                   Two officers roughly shove FRANCIS into the room.  He falls 
                   to his knees.  The Warden quickly stands.
    
                                         WARDEN
                             Enough!
    
                   The two guards back out of the room.
    
                                         FRANCIS
                             Warden... I...
    
                                         JAKE
                             Francis?  Francis!
    
                                         FRANCIS
                             Wha?  Jake?  That you?
    
                   He quickly stands up.  They momentarily stare at each other 
                   before hugging.
    
                                         JAKE
                             It's good to see you, Bud.
    
                   All of the sudden, Jake shoves him away a bit.
    
                                         JAKE (CONT'D)
                             Why the hell are you lettin' them 
                             push you around, Francis?  Huh?  
                             What would Ma think?
    
                   The Warden clears his voice, and they both slowly turn to 
                   him.
    
                                         WARDEN
                             Save the reunion festivities for 
                             later, won't you?  We are here to 
                             work out some details.
    
                                         FRANCIS
                             Huh?  For what?  What is this, Jake?
    
                                         JAKE
                             I dunno.  Warden... what did you 
                             mean?  I'm not havin' a hearing?
    
                                         WARDEN
                             Do you really think they are ever 
                             going to let you out, Jake?  
                             Seriously?
    
                                         JAKE
                             Sure.  I have...
    
                                         WARDEN
                             No.  They won't.  Roaches like 
                             yourselves are destined to scurry in 
                             the halls of prison your entire lives.  
                             Sure.  You may see the light of day, 
                             but you always come home to nest.
    
                                         JAKE
                             Oh.
    
                                         WARDEN
                             However, there are other ways out of 
                             this uh, "Roach Motel".  Can I 
                             interest you in an open door?
    
                                         FRANCIS
                             Wait.  We been here for over fifteen 
                             years without ever talkin' with you... 
                             sides' our introduction the first 
                             day.  Now...
    
                                         JAKE
                             ...You're our best friend?  Like I 
                             asked before, you guys setting us 
                             up?
    
                   The Warden smirks a bit, then stands up.  He casually walks 
                   over to Jake and Francis.
    
                                         FRANCIS
                             Oh, I'm not your friend.  Never 
                             confuse that with what we are talking 
                             about here.  I would just as soon 
                             shoot you as feed you.  You two are 
                             nothing besides green to line my 
                             pockets with.  If it weren't for 
                             money, we wouldn't be here talking.
    
                                         JAKE
                             We don't have any money, Warden.
    
                   Suddenly a voice comes from a darkened corner of the room.  
                   Chester Copperpot III.
    
                                         CHESTER
                             Yes, but gentlemen... I do. 
    
                   They both spin to look at a face they can't see.  Chester 
                   makes no move to help them see.
    
                                         FRANCIS
                             Who the Hell?
    
                                         WARDEN
                             You two have only one chance.
    
                   He picks up two very thick folders from his desk.
    
                                         WARDEN (CONT'D)
                             Knowing how stupid you two are, I 
                             know one isn't enough.  But one it 
                             is.  Your friend here -- Um, OUR 
                             friend here -- has made me happy.  
                             Happy enough to chance several things 
                             on you.  You blow this, and I report 
                             you as escaped.  I guarantee that I 
                             can put together a manhunt big enough 
                             to scrape you from whatever shoe you 
                             try to hide under.  You do what he 
                             asks -- and then quietly disappear 
                             when you are done... and these files 
                             are filed away permanently.  With my 
                             signature.  Nobody will ask questions 
                             that I can't answer.

                             This ain't no trick?
    
                                         CHESTER
                             No.  Do exactly as I ask, and you 
                             two will be free men within a week.

                             That is a scary thought.
    
                                         JAKE
                             What's the catch?
    
                                         CHESTER
                             No catch really.  You just have to 
                             promise me that I will have your 
                             undivided attention and commitment 
                             for the next week.  No questions 
                             asked.

                             No problem!  You got it... What are 
                             we doing?  Housework?  Cleaning your 
                             car?  Driving you around...
    
                                         CHESTER
                             You may actually enjoy this.  One 
                             last job... finishing up something 
                             that you had already started.
    
                                         JAKE
                             All it's gonna' to cost us is one 
                             week?
    
                                         CHESTER
                             Gentlemen, it may end up costing you 
                             your lives.
    
                                         WARDEN
                             We can only hope!
