# Woman in the Dark

    
    
    
    1	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
    	A WOMAN'S RIGHT ANKLE turns under her and ...
    
    2	... the WOMAN falls. The wind blowing downhill from 
    	the south, whipping the trees beside the road, makes 
    	a whisper of her exclamation and snatches her scarf.
    
    3	The SCARF flies away into the darkness. 
    
    4	The WOMAN sits up slowly, palms on the gravel pushing 
    	her up, and twists her body sidewise to release the 
    	leg bent beneath her. We notice the rings on her 
    	fingers. She looks around at:
    
    5	Her right SLIPPER lying in the road close to her feet. 
    
    6	The WOMAN grabs the slipper, puts it on and finds its 
    	heel is missing. She peers around, then begins to hunt 
    	for the heel, hunting on hands and knees uphill into 
    	the wind, wincing a little when her right knee touches 
    	the road. 
    
    7	The WOMAN gives up and tries to break the heel off her 
    	left slipper, but cannot. She replaces the slipper and 
    	rises with her back to the wind, leaning back against 
    	the wind's violence and the road's steep sloping. Her 
    	red gown clings to her back, fluttering out before her. 
    	Hair lashes her cheeks. Walking high on the ball of her 
    	right foot to make up for the missing heel, she hobbles
    	down the hill.
    
    8	At the bottom of the hill, she crosses a WOODEN BRIDGE.
    
    9 	Beyond the bridge she comes to a FORK IN THE ROAD, with 
    	a sign that cannot be read in the darkness. She halts 
    	there, not looking at the sign but around her, shivering 
    	now, though the wind has less force than it had had on 
    	the hill. 
    
    10	FOLIAGE to her left moves to show and hide yellow light. 
    	She takes the left-hand fork.
    
    11	She comes to a GAP in the bushes beside the road and 
    	sufficient light to show a path running off the road 
    	through the gap. She sees:
    
    12	The light comes from the thinly curtained window of a 
    	HOUSE at the other end of the path. 
    
    13	She goes up the PATH to the door and knocks. 
    
    14	When there is no answer she knocks on the DOOR again. 
    	A hoarse, unemotional masculine voice says: "Come in." 
    	She puts her hand on the latch; hesitates. No sound 
    	comes from within the house. Outside, the wind is 
    	noisy everywhere. She knocks once more, gently. The 
    	voice says, exactly as before: "Come in." She opens 
    	the door. 
    
    15	INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
    	The wind blows the DOOR in sharply, her hold on the 
    	latch dragging her with it so that she has to cling 
    	to the door with both hands to keep from falling. 
    
    16	The wind blows past her into the ROOM, to balloon 
    	curtains and scatter the sheets of a newspaper on a 
    	table. 
    
    17	She forces the door shut and leans against it.
    
    				WOMAN
    		I am sorry.
    
    	She takes pains with her words to make them clear 
    	notwithstanding her accent.
    
    18	A MAN sits at a hearth, cleaning a pipe. His 
    	copperish eyes are as impersonal as his hoarse voice.
    
    				MAN
    		It's all right. I'll be through in a 
    		minute.
    
    	He does not rise from his chair. The edge of the 
    	knife in his hand rasps inside the brier bowl of his 
    	pipe.
    
    19	The WOMAN leaves the door and comes forward, limping, 
    	examining him with perplexed eyes under brows drawn a 
    	little together. A tall woman, she carries herself 
    	proudly, for all she is lame and the wind has tousled 
    	her hair and the gravel of the road has cut and 
    	dirtied her and her gown.
    
    				WOMAN
    		I must go to the railroad. I have 
    		hurt my ankle on the road.
    
    20 	The MAN looks up from his work. His face is not 
    	definitely hostile or friendly. He looks at:
    
    21 	Her FACE.
    
    22	The MAN lowers his eyes to look at:
    
    23	Her torn SKIRT. 
    
    24	The MAN does not turn his head to call: 
    
    				MAN
    		Hey, Evelyn. 
    
    	A GIRL -- slim maturing body in tan sport clothes
    	-- comes into the room through a doorway behind him. 
    	The man does not look around at her. He nods at the 
    	woman in red. 
    
    				MAN
    		This, uh...   
    
    				WOMAN
    			(interrupts)
    		My name is Luise Fischer.
    
    				MAN
    		She's got a bum leg.
    
    	Evelyn's eyes shift their focus from Luise to the 
    	man -- she can't see his face -- and to Luise again. 
    	She smiles and speaks hurriedly: 
    
    				EVELYN
    		I'm just leaving. I can drop you at 
    		Mile Valley on my way home.
     
    25	LUISE seems about to smile, gazing curiously at:
    
    26	EVELYN who suddenly blushes, her face becoming defiant 
    	while it reddens. 
    
    27	The MAN blows through his pipe, forcing out a small 
    	cloud of black powder. 
    
    				MAN
    		No use hurrying. There's no train 
    		till six.
    
    	He looks up at:
    
    28	The CLOCK on the mantelpiece. It says ten-thirty-three. 
    
    29	LUISE, the MAN, and EVELYN -- lit by the firelight.
    
    				MAN
    			(to Evelyn)
    		Why don't you help her with her 
    		leg?
    
    				LUISE
    		No, it is not necessary. I --
    
    	Luise puts her weight on her injured leg and flinches, 
    	steadying herself with a hand on the back of a chair. 
    	Evelyn hurries to her.
    
    				EVELYN
    			(stammering contritely)
    		I -- I didn't think. Forgive me.
    
    	She puts an arm around Luise and helps her into the 
    	chair.
    
    30	The MAN stands up to put his pipe on the mantelpiece, 
    	beside the clock. He clicks his knife shut and puts it 
    	in his pocket before turning to look at:
    
    31	EVELYN AND LUISE
    	Evelyn is on her knees in front of Luise, pulling off 
    	her right stocking, making sympathetic clucking 
    	noises, chattering nervously.
    
    				EVELYN
    		You've cut your knee too. Tch-tch-tch! 
    		And look how your ankle's swelling. 
    		You shouldn't've tried to walk all 
    		that distance in these slippers. Now, 
    		sit still and I'll fix it up in a 
    		minute.
    
    	She pulls the torn red skirt down over the bare leg. 
    	Luise smiles politely. 
    
    				LUISE
    		You are very kind.
    
    	Evelyn runs out of the room. 
    
    32	The MAN joins LUISE with a paper package of 
    	cigarettes in his hand. He shakes it until three 
    	cigarettes protrude half an inch and holds them 
    	out to her. 
    
    				MAN
    		Smoke? 
    
    				LUISE
    		Thank you.
    
    	She takes a cigarette, puts it between her lips, and 
    	looks at his hand when he holds a match to it. 
    
    				MAN
    			(merely conversational)
    		Bang it up much? 
    
    				LUISE
    		I hope I have not.
    
    	She draws up her skirt to look first at her ankle, 
    	then at her knee. The ankle is not greatly swollen; 
    	the knee is cut once deeply, twice less seriously. 
    	She touches the edges of the cuts gently with a 
    	forefinger. 
    
    				LUISE
    			(earnestly)
    		I do not like pain. 
    
    	The man stares at her leg.
    
    33	EVELYN comes in with a basin of steaming water, 
    	cloths, a roll of bandage, salve. Her eyes widen at:
    
    34	The MAN looking at Luise's bare leg. Their faces 
    	turn toward:
    
    25	EVELYN as she hides her eyes with lowered lids and 
    	joins them.
    
    				EVELYN
    		I'll fix it now. I'll have it all 
    		fixed in a minute.
    
    	She kneels in front of Luise again, nervous hand 
    	sloshing water on the floor, body between Luise's leg 
    	and the man. 
    
    26	The MAN goes to the door and looks out, holding the 
    	door half a foot open against the wind.
    
    27	EVELYN bathes Luise's ankle.
    
    				LUISE
    		There is not a train before it is
    		morning?
    
    				EVELYN
    		No.
    
    28	The MAN shuts the door.
    
    				MAN
    		It'll be raining in an hour.
    
    29	The MAN puts more wood on the fire, then stands -- 
    	legs apart, hands in pockets, cigarette dangling from 
    	one side of his mouth watching Evelyn attend to 
    	Luise's leg. His face is placid.
    
    30	EVELYN dries the ankle and begins to wind a bandage 
    	around it, working with increasing speed, breathing 
    	more rapidly now. 
    
    31	Once more LUISE seems about to smile at her.
    
    				LUISE
    		You are very kind.
    
    				EVELYN
    			(murmurs) 
    		It's nothing.
    
    	Three sharp KNOCKS sound on the door.
     
    	LUISE starts, drops her cigarette, looks swiftly 
    	around the room with frightened eyes. 
    
    32	EVELYN does not raise her head from her work. 
    
    33	The MAN, with nothing in his face or manner to show 
    	he had noticed Luise's fright, turns his face toward 
    	the door and calls in his hoarse, matter-of-fact 
    	voice: 
    
    				MAN
    		All right. Come in.
    
    34	The DOOR opens and a spotted Great Dane comes in, 
    	followed by two tall men in dinner clothes. 
    
    35	The dog walks straight to LUISE and nuzzles her hand. 
    	She looks at the two men who have just entered with 
    	no timidity, no warmth in her gaze. 
    
    36	One of THE MEN pulls off his cap -- a gray tweed, 
    	matching his topcoat -- and comes to LUISE, smiling. 
    
    				GRAY TWEED
    		So this is where you landed? 
    
    	His smile vanishes as he sees her leg and the 
    	bandages. 
    
    				GRAY TWEED
    		What happened? 
    
    	He is perhaps forty years old, well groomed, graceful 
    	of carriage. He pushes the dog aside and takes Luise's 
    	hand.
    
    				LUISE
    			(cool, unsmiling)
    		It is not serious, I think. I 
    		stumbled in the road and twisted my 
    		ankle. These people have been 
    		very-- 
    
    37	GRAY TWEED turns to the man with the pipe, holding 
    	out his hand.
    
    				GRAY TWEED
    			(briskly)
    		Thanks ever so much for taking care 
    		of Fraulein Fischer. You're Brazil, 
    		aren't you? 
    
    	The man nods. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		And you'd be Kane Robson.
    
    				ROBSON
    		Right.
    
    	Robson jerks his head at the man standing just inside 
    	the door. 
    
    				ROBSON
    		Mr. Conroy.
    
    	Brazil nods his acknowledgement to:
    
    38	CONROY -- who is taller than Robson, some ten years 
    	younger, broad-shouldered, and lean. He advances 
    	toward Luise.
    
    				CONROY
    			(to Brazil)
    		How do you do?
    			(smiling down at Luise)
    		Your idea of a lark's immense.
    
    39	LUISE ignores Conroy and addresses Robson.
    
    				LUISE
    		Why have you come here?
    
    40	ROBSON smiles amiably, raises his shoulders a little. 
    
    				ROBSON
    		You said you weren't feeling well 
    		and were going to lie down. When 
    		Helen went up to your room to see 
    		how you were, you weren't there. We 
    		were afraid you had gone out and 
    		something had happened to you.
    			(beat)
    		Well, we were right.
    
    41	Nothing in LUISE's face responds to his smile. 
    
    				LUISE
    		I am going to the city. Now you 
    		know.
    
    42	ROBSON is good natured.
    
    				ROBSON
    		All right, if you want to. But you 
    		can't go like that. We'll take you 
    		back home, where you can change your 
    		clothes and pack a bag and --
    			(turns to Brazil)
    		When's the next train?
     
    43	The dog is sniffing at BRAZIL's legs. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Six.
    
    44 	ROBSON joins LUISE.
    
    				ROBSON
    			(blandly)
    		You see? There's plenty of time.
    
    	Luise looks down at her clothes and seems to find 
    	them satisfactory. 
    
    				LUISE
    		I go like this.
    
    				ROBSON
    			(reasonably)
    		Now, look here, Luise. You've got 
    		hours before train time -- time 
    		enough to get some rest and a nap 
    		and to --
    
    				LUISE
    		I have gone.
    
    	Robson grimaces impatiently, half humorously, and 
    	turns his palms out in a gesture of helplessness. 
    
    				ROBSON
    		But what are you going to do? 
    		You're not going to expect Brazil 
    		to put you up till train time and 
    		then drive you to the station? 
    
    45	LUISE looks at Brazil with level eyes.
    
    				LUISE
    			(calmly)
    		Is it too much?
    
    46	BRAZIL shakes his head carelessly. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Uh-uh.
     
    47	ROBSON AND CONROY turn together to look at Brazil. 
    	There is considerable interest in their eyes, but 
    	no visible hostility. 
    
    48	BRAZIL bears the inspection placidly.
    
    49	LUISE's face is impassive. 
    
    				LUISE
    			(with an air of finality)
    		So.
    
    50	Conroy looks questioningly at ROBSON, who sighs 
    	wearily.
    
     				ROBSON
    		Your mind's made up on this, Luise?
    
    				LUISE (o.s.)
    		Yes.
    
     				ROBSON
    			(gravely) 
    		You always know what you want. 
    
    	He starts to turn away toward the door, then stops.
    
     				ROBSON
    		Have you got enough money? 
    
    	One of his hands goes into the inner breast pocket of 
    	his dinner jacket. 
    
    				LUISE (o.s.)
    		I want nothing.
    
     				ROBSON
    		Right. If you want anything later, 
    		let me know. 
    			(to Conroy)
    		Come on, Dick.
    
    	He goes to the door, opens it, twists his head 
    	around in Brazil's direction.  
    
     				ROBSON
    			(briskly, to Brazil)
    		Thanks, good night.
    
    	Robson goes out.
     
    51	CONROY touches Luise's forearm lightly.
    
    				CONROY
    		Good luck.
    
    	He bows to Evelyn and Brazil and follows Robson out. 
    
    52	The DOG raises his head to watch the two men go out. 
    
    53	EVELYN stares at the door with despairing eyes and 
    	works her hands together. 
    
    54	LUISE looks to Brazil.
    
    				LUISE
    		You will be wise to lock your door.
    
    55	BRAZIL stares at her for a long moment, brooding.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		No. I won't lock it.
    
    56	LUISE's eyebrows go up a little, but she says nothing.  
    
    57	EVELYN AND BRAZIL
    
    				EVELYN
    			(emphatic) 
    		They were drunk.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		They've been drinking.
    
    	He looks thoughtfully at her, apparently only now 
    	noticing her perturbation. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		You look like a drink would do you
    		some good. 
    
    	She becomes confused. Her eyes evade his. 
    
    				EVELYN
    		Do -- do you want one?
    
    				BRAZIL
    		I think so.
    
    	He looks inquiringly at:
    
    58	LUISE, who nods.
    
    				LUISE
    		Thank you.
    
    59	EVELYN, after looking from Luise to Brazil, goes out 
    	of the room. 
    
    60	LUISE leans forward a little to look intently up at 
    	Brazil. Her voice is calm enough, but the deliberate 
    	slowness with which she speaks make her words 
    	impressive: 
    
    				LUISE
    		Do not make the mistake of thinking 
    		Mr. Robson is not dangerous.
    
    61	BRAZIL seems to weigh this speech almost sleepily.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(slight curiosity)
    		I've made an enemy? 
    
    62	LUISE nods with certainty.
    
    63 	BRAZIL accepts that with a faint grin, offering her 
    	his cigarettes again.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Have you?
    
    64	LUISE stares through him as if studying some distant 
    	thing.
    
    				LUISE
    		Yes, but I have lost a worse friend.
     
    65	FULL SHOT - Evelyn comes in, carrying a tray that 
    	holds glasses, mineral water, and a bottle of whiskey. 
    	Her eyes, glancing from man to woman, are inquisitive, 
    	somewhat furtive. She goes to the table and begins to 
    	mix drinks.
    
    	Brazil finishes lighting his cigarette.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Leaving him for good? 
    
    66	For a moment, LUISE stares haughtily at him ... but 
    	suddenly her face is distorted by an expression of 
    	utter hatred.
    
    				LUISE
    			(venomous)
    		Ja!
    
    67	BRAZIL sets his glass on the mantelpiece and goes to 
    	the door. He goes through the motions of looking out 
    	into the night; yet he opens the door a bare couple 
    	of inches and shuts it immediately, and his manner is 
    	so far from nervous that he seems preoccupied with 
    	something else.
    
    	He returns to the mantelpiece, picks up his glass, 
    	and drinks. Then, his eyes focus contemplatively on 
    	the lowered glass. He is about to speak when a 
    	telephone bell RINGS behind a door facing the 
    	fireplace. He opens the door, and as soon as he 
    	passes out of sight his hoarse, unemotional voice 
    	can be heard. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Hello ... Yes ... Yes, Nora ... 
    		Just a moment.
    
    	He re-enters the room.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(to Evelyn)
    		Nora wants to talk to you.
    
    	Evelyn enters the bedroom and Brazil shuts the door 
    	behind her.
    
    68	LUISE and BRAZIL 
    
    				LUISE
    		You cannot have lived here long if 
    		you did not know Kane Robson before 
    		tonight.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		A month or so; but, of course, he 
    		was in Europe till he came back 
    		last week...
    			(beat)
    		... with you. 
    			(beat)
    		Matter of fact, he is my landlord.
    
    				LUISE
    		Then you -- 
    
    	She breaks off as:
    
    69 	The bedroom door opens. EVELYN stands in the doorway, 
    	hands to breast
    
    				EVELYN
    		Father's coming -- somebody phoned 
    		him I was here.
    
    	She hurries across the room to pick up hat and coat 
    	from a chaiir.
     
    70	BRAZIL and EVELYN
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Wait. You'll meet him on the road 
    		if you go now. You'll have to wait 
    		till he gets here, then duck out 
    		back and beat him home while he's 
    		jawing at me. I'll stick your car 
    		down at the foot of the back road.
    
    	He drains his glass and starts for the bedroom door. 
    
    				EVELYN
    			(her lip quivers)
    		But you won't -- won't fight with 
    		him. Promise me you won't.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		I won't.
    
    71	BRAZIL goes into the bedroom, returns almost 
    	immediately with a hat on his head and one of his 
    	arms in a raincoat. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		It'll only take me five minutes.
    
    	He goes out the front door.
    
    72	LUISE and EVELYN
    
    				LUISE
    		Your father does not approve?
    
    	Evelyn shakes her head miserably. Then suddenly she 
    	turns to Luise, holding her hands out in an appealing 
    	gesture.
    
    				EVELYN
    		You'll be here. Don't let them 
    		fight. They mustn't.
     
    	Luise takes Evelyn's hands and puts them together 
    	between her own.
    
    				LUISE
    		I will do what I can, I promise you.
    
    				EVELYN
    		He mustn't get in trouble again. He 
    		mustn't. 
    
    	Luise doesn't know quite what to make of that.
    
    					DISSOLVE TO:
    
    73	INT. HOUSE - FIVE MINUTES LATER
    	The door opens, revealing a downpour, and Brazil 
    	comes in. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(cheerfully)
    		That's done.
    
    	He takes off his raincoat, drops it on a chair, and 
    	puts his damp hat on it. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		I left it at the end of the fence.
    
    	Evelyn and Luise watch as he picks up Luise's empty 
    	glass and his own and goes to the table. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(to Evelyn)
    		Better slide out to the kitchen in 
    		case he pops in suddenly.
    
    	He begins to pour whiskey into the glasses.
    
    74	EVELYN wets her lips with her tongue and joins Brazil.
    
    				EVELYN
    		Yes, I guess so.
    
    	She smiles timidly, pleadingly, at Luise, hesitates, 
    	and touches Brazil's sleeve with her fingers. 
    
    				EVELYN
    		You -- you'll behave?
    
    	He does not stop preparing his drinks.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Sure. I'll call you up tomorrow.
    
    	She smiles at Luise, moves reluctantly toward the 
    	door and leaves.
    
    75	BRAZIL and LUISE
    	Brazil gives Luise her glass, pulls a chair around to 
    	face her more directly, and sits down.
    
    				LUISE
    		Your little friend. She loves you 
    		very much.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(doubtful)
    		Oh, she's just a kid.
    
    				LUISE
    		But her father ... he is not nice, 
    		eh? 
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(carelessly)
    		He's cracked.
    			(becoming thoughtful)
    		Suppose Robson phoned him?
    
    				LUISE
    		Would he know?
    
    				BRAZIL
    		In a place like this everybody 
    		knows all about everybody.
    
    				LUISE
    		Then about me ... you -- 
    
    	She is interrupted by a pounding on the door that 
    	shakes it on its hinges. 
    
    76	The DOG gets up, stiff-legged on its feet. 
    
    77	BRAZIL gives Luise a brief grim smile.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(calls out)
    		All right. Come in.
    
    78	The door opens violently. A BEARDED MAN in a 
    	glistening black rubber coat enters.  One fist grips a 
    	heavy applewood walking stick.
    
    				BEARDED MAN
    			(a deep, powerful voice)
    		Where is my daughter?
    
    79	BRAZIL's face is a phlegmatic mask. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Hello, Grant.
    
    80  	GRANT steps forward. 
    
    				GRANT
    		Where is my daughter?
    
    81 	The DOG growls and shows its teeth. 
    
    82	LUISE admonishes the dog: 
    
    				LUISE
    		Franz!
    
    83	The DOG looks at her and quiets down.
    
    84	FULL SHOT - the room.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Evelyn's not here.
    
    	Grant glares at him. 
    
    				GRANT
    		Where is she? 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		I don't know.
    
    				GRANT
    		That's a lie!
    
    85	GRANT's eyes dart their burning gaze around the room. 
    	The knuckles of his hand holding the stick are white. 
    
    				GRANT
    			(calls out)
    		Evelyn?!
    
    86	LUISE smiles as if entertained by Grant's rage.
    
    				LUISE
    		It is so, Mr. Grant. There is 
    		nobody else here.
    
    87	GRANT glances briefly at her, with loathing in his 
    	mad eyes. 
    
    				GRANT
    		Bah! The strumpet's word confirms 
    		the convict's!
    
    	He strides to the bedroom door and disappears inside.
    
    88	BRAZIL grins at LUISE. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		See? He's cracked. He always talks 
    		like that -- like a guy in a bum 
    		book.
    
    				LUISE
    			(smiles) 
    		Be patient.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(dryly)
    		I'm being.
    
    89	GRANT comes out of the bedroom and stamps across to 
    	the rear door, opens it, and disappears through it.
    
    90	BRAZIL empties his glass and puts it on the floor 
    	beside his chair. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		There'll be more fireworks when he 
    		comes back.
    
    91	GRANT abruptly returns to the room, stalks in silence 
    	to the front door, pulls it open, and, holding the 
    	latch with one hand, banging the ferrule of his 
    	walking stick on the floor with the other, roars at 
    	Brazil: 
    
    				GRANT
    		For the last time, I'm telling you 
    		not to have anything to do with my 
    		daughter! I shan't tell you again! 
    
    	He goes out, slamming the door.
    
    92	BRAZIL exhales heavily and shakes his head. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Cracked. Absolutely cracked.
    
    93	A look of concern on LUISE's face.
    
    				LUISE
    		He called me a strumpet. Do people 
    		here -- ?
    
    94	But BRAZIL isn't listening to her. He leaves his 
    	chair and picks up his hat and coat. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		I want to slip down and see if she 
    		got away all right. If she gets home 
    		first she'll be okay. Nora -- that's 
    		her stepmother -- will take care of 
    		her. But if she doesn't -- 
    			(shrugs)
    		I won't be long.
    
    	He goes out the back way.
    
    95	Left alone, LUISE stares at her feet for a moment, 
    	then kicks off her remaining slipper and stands up, 
    	experimenting with her weight on her injured leg. 
    	Three tentative steps prove her leg stiff but 
    	serviceable. 
    
    96	LUISE notices that her hands and arms are still dirty 
    	from the road and, exploring, enters the bedroom to
    	find a bathroom. 
    
    					CUT TO:
    
    97	IN THE BATHROOM - Luise hums a tune to herself while 
    	she washes her arms in the sink.
    
    					CUT TO:
    
    98A	IN THE BEDROOM
    	LUISE combs her hair ...
    
    98B	... brushes her clothes ... 
    
    98C	... studies her reflection in a tall looking-glass.
    
    99	She hears the outer door opening. Her face brightens. 
    
    				LUISE
    			(calls out)
    		I am here!
    
    	She limps into the other room. 
    
    100	IN THE MAIN ROOM
    	LUISE enters the main room.
    
    				LUISE
    		I am here --
    
    	She gasps, startled to see:
    
    101	ROBSON AND CONROY 
    	The men stand inside the door. Robson smiles at her.
    
    				ROBSON
    		So you are, my dear.
    
    	He is paler than before and his eyes are glassier, 
    	but he seems otherwise unchanged. Conroy, however, 
    	is somewhat disheveled; his face flushed and 
    	obviously rather drunk. 
    
    102	LUISE recovers her composure. 
    
    				LUISE
    			(bluntly)
    		What do you want?
     
    103  	ROBSON looks around. 
    
    				ROBSON
    		Where's Brazil?
    
    104	LUISE stands her ground.
    
    				LUISE
    		What do you want?
    
    105	ROBSON looks past her at the open bedroom door, grins, 
    	and crosses to it. When he turns from the empty room 
    	she sneers at him. 
    
    106	CONROY has gone to the fireplace, where the Great 
    	Dane lies, and stands with his back to the fire, 
    	watching them.
    
    107	ROBSON AND LUISE
    
    				ROBSON
    		Well, it's like this, Luise: 
    		you're going back home with me.
    
    				LUISE
    		No.
    
    	Robson wags his head up and down, grinning.
    
    				ROBSON
    		I haven't got my money's worth out 
    		of you yet.
    
    	He takes a step toward her. She retreats to the 
    	table, catches up the whiskey bottle by its neck. 
    
    				LUISE
    			(cold with fury)
    		Do not touch me ... 
    
    108 	The DOG rises, growling.
    
    109	ROBSON's eyes jerk sidewise to focus on the dog, 
    	then on Conroy -- one eyelid twitches -- then on 
    	Luise again.
    
    110	CONROY -- with neither tenseness nor furtiveness to 
    	alarm woman or dog -- puts his right hand into his 
    	overcoat pocket, brings out a black pistol, puts its 
    	muzzle close behind one of the dog's ears, and shoots 
    	the dog through the head. 
    
    111	LUISE spins around at the sound of the shot.
    
    112	The DOG falls on its side; its legs stir feebly. 
    
    113	CONROY, smiling foolishly, returns the pistol to his 
    	pocket. 
    
    114	Horrified, LUISE raises the bottle to hurl it at 
    	Conroy, but Robson catches her wrist with one hand, 
    	wrenches the bottle away with the other. He grins.
    
    				ROBSON
    			(in a bantering voice)
    		No, no, my sweet.
    
    	He puts the bottle on the table again, but keeps 
    	his grip on her wrist. 
    
    115	The DOG's legs stop moving. 
    
    116	ROBSON AND LUISE
    
    				ROBSON
    		All right. Now, are you ready to 
    		go?
    
    	She makes no attempt to free her wrist. She draws 
    	herself up straight.
    
    				LUISE
    		My friend, you do not know me yet 
    		if you think I am going with you. 
    
    				ROBSON
    			(chuckles) 
    		You don't know me if you think 
    		you're not.
    
    117	The front door opens and BRAZIL comes in. His face is 
    	phlegmatic, though there is a shade of annoyance in 
    	his eyes. He shuts the door carefully behind him, 
    	then addresses his guests. His voice is that of one 
    	who complains without anger. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		What the hell is this? Visitor's 
    		day? Am I supposed to be running a 
    		roadhouse?
    
    118	FULL SHOT - the room.
    
    				ROBSON
    		We are going now. Frulein Fischer's 
    		going with us.
    
    	Brazil looks at the dead dog, annoyed. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(indifferently)
    		That's all right if she wants to.
    
    				LUISE
    		I am not going.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(still looking at the dog)
    		That's all right too. 
    			(with more interest) 
    		But who did this?
     
    119	BRAZIL AND CONROY
    	Brazil walks over to the dog and prods its head with 
    	his foot. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(grumbles)
    		Blood all over the floor.
    
    	Then, without raising his head, without the slightest 
    	shifting of balance or stiffening of his body, he 
    	drives his right fist up into Conroy's handsome, 
    	drunken face.
    
    120	CONROY falls away from the fist rigidly, with upbent 
    	knees, turning a little as he falls. His head and one 
    	shoulder strike the stone fireplace, and he tumbles 
    	forward, rolling completely over, face upward, on the 
    	floor.
    
    121	BRAZIL whirls to face Robson. 
    
    122	ROBSON drops the woman's wrist and tries to get a 
    	pistol out of his overcoat pocket. But Luise flings 
    	herself on his arm, hugging it to her body, hanging 
    	with her full weight on it, and he can't free it, 
    	though he tears her hair with his other hand. Brazil 
    	goes around behind Robson, strikes his chin up with a 
    	fist so he can slide his forearm under it across the
    	taller man's throat. Brazil tightens his forearm 
    	there and wraps his other hand around Robson's wrist.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		All right. I've got him.
    
    123	LUISE releases the man's arm and falls back on her 
    	haunches. Except for the triumph in it, her face is 
    	as businesslike as Brazil's.
    
    124	BRAZIL AND ROBSON
    	Brazil pulls Robson's arm up sharply behind his back. 
    	The pistol comes up with it, and when the pistol is 
    	horizontal Robson pulls the trigger. The bullet goes  
    	between his back and Brazil's chest, to splinter the 
    	corner of a bookcase in the far end of the room. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Try that again, baby, and I'll 
    		break your arms. Drop it! 
    
    	Robson hesitates, lets the pistol clatter down on the 
    	floor. 
    
    125	LUISE scrambles forward on hands and knees to pick it 
    	up. She sits on a corner of the table, holding the 
    	pistol in her hand.
    
    126	BRAZIL pushes Robson away from him and crosses the 
    	room to kneel beside the man on the floor, feeling 
    	his pulse, running hands over his body, and rising 
    	with Conroy's pistol, which he thrusts into a hip 
    	pocket.
    
    127	CONROY moves one leg, his eyelids flutter sleepily, 
    	and he groans. 
    
    128	BRAZIL jerks a thumb at him and addresses Robson.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(curtly)
    		Take Mr. Conroy and get out.
    
    129	ROBSON goes over to Conroy, stoops to lift his head 
    	and shoulders a little, shakes him.
    
    				ROBSON
    			(irritably)
    		Come on, Conroy, wake up. We're 
    		going.
    
    				CONROY
    			(mumbles)
    		I'm a' ri' ...
    
    	Conroy tries to lie down again.
    
    				ROBSON
    			(snarling)
    		Get up, get up. 
    
    	Robson slaps Conroy's cheeks. Conroy shakes his head.
    
    				CONROY
    		Don' wanna.
    
    	Robson slaps his face again. 
    
    				ROBSON
    		Come on, get up, you louse.
    
    	Conroy groans and mumbles something unintelligible.
    
    130	FULL SHOT - the room.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(impatiently)
    		Get him out anyway. The rain'll 
    		bring him around.
    
    	Robson starts to speak, changes his mind, picks up 
    	his hat from the floor, puts it on, and bends over 
    	Conroy again. He pulls him up into something 
    	approaching a sitting position, draws one limp arm 
    	over his shoulder, gets a hand around Conroy's back 
    	and under his armpit, and rises, slowly lifting the 
    	other on unsteady legs beside him.
    
    131	AT THE FRONT DOOR
    	Brazil holds the front door open. Half dragging, half 
    	carrying Conroy, Robson goes out. Brazil shuts the 
    	door, leans his back against it, and shakes his head 
    	in mock resignation .
    
    132	LUISE and BRAZIL
    	Luise puts Robson's pistol down on the table and 
    	stands up. 
    
    				LUISE
    			(gravely)
    		I am sorry. I did not mean to bring 
    		to you all this.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(carelessly)
    		That's all right. I go on like this 
    		all the time. God! I need a drink.
    
    	She turns swiftly to the table and begins to fill 
    	glasses.
     
    133	BRAZIL joins LUISE, looking her up and down 
    	reflectively as they drink.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		You walked out just like that?
    
    	She looks down at her clothes and nods yes. He seems 
    	amused. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		What are you going to do?
    
    				LUISE
    		When I go to the city? I shall sell 
    		these things ...
    			(she moves her hands to 
    			indicate her rings)
    		... and then -- I do not know.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		You mean you haven't any money at 
    		all? 
    
    				LUISE
    		That is it.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Not even enough for your ticket?
    
    	She shakes her head no, raises her eyebrows a little, 
    	and her calmness is almost insolence. 
    
    				LUISE
    		Surely that is a small amount you 
    		can afford to lend me.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Sure.
    			(laughs)
    		But you're a pip.
    
    	She does not seem to understand him. He drinks again, 
    	then leans forward. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Listen, you're going to look funny 
    		riding the train like that. Suppose 
    		I drive you in and I've got some 
    		friends that'll put you up till you 
    		get hold of some clothes you can go 
    		out in?
    
    	She studies his face carefully.
    
    				LUISE
    		If it is not too much trouble for you.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		That's settled, then. Want to catch 
    		a nap first?
    
    	He empties his glass and goes to the front door.
    
    134 	BRAZIL opens the door and makes a pretense of looking 
    	out at the night. As he turns from the door he sees:
    
    135	LUISE frowning at him, curious.
    
    136	BRAZIL smiles, his voice mockingly apologetic: 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		I can't help it. They had me away 
    		for a while in prison, I mean -- 
    		and it did that to me. I've got to 
    		keep making sure I'm not locked in.
    
    	His smile becomes more twisted. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		There's a name for it -- 
    		claustrophobia -- and that doesn't 
    		make it any better.
    
    				LUISE (o.s.)
    		I am sorry. Was it very long ago?
     
    				BRAZIL
    			(dryly)
    		Plenty long ago when I went in but 
    		only a few weeks ago that I got out. 
    		That's what I came up here for -- 
    		to try to get myself straightened 
    		out, see how I stood, what I wanted 
    		to do.
    
    				LUISE (o.s.)
    			(softly)
    		And?
    
    				BRAZIL
    		And what? Have I found out where I 
    		stand, what I want to do? I don't 
    		know. I suppose I've just been 
    		waiting for something to turn up, 
    		something I could take as a sign 
    		which way I was to go. Well, what 
    		turned up was you. That's good 
    		enough. I'll go along with you.
    
    137	BRAZIL approaches Luise, leans down, lifts her to her 
    	feet, and kisses her savagely. For a moment she is 
    	motionless. Then she angrily squirms out of his arms 
    	and strikes at his face. He catches her hand and 
    	pushes it down carelessly.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(growls)
    		Stop it. If you don't want to play, 
    		you don't want to play, that's all.
    
    				LUISE
    			(furiously)
    		That is exactly all.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Fair enough.
    
    	No change in his face, none in his voice. 
    
    					DISSOLVE TO:
    
    138	INT. HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
    	The CLOCK reads after midnight.
    
    139	LUISE and BRAZIL sit quietly, smoking.
    
    				LUISE
    		That man -- your little friend's 
    		father -- called me a strumpet. Do 
    		people here talk very much about 
    		me?
    
    				BRAZIL
    		You know how it is. The Robsons 
    		have been the big landowners, the 
    		local gentry, for generations, and 
    		anything they do is big news. 
    		Everybody knows everything they do 
    		and so --
    
    				LUISE
    		And what do they say about me?
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(grins)
    		The worst, of course. What do you 
    		expect? They know him.
    
    				LUISE
    		And what do you think?
    
    				BRAZIL
    		About you?
    
    	She nods. Her eyes are intent on his.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		I can't very well go around panning 
    		people ... only I wonder why you 
    		ever took up with him. You must've 
    		seen him for the rat he is.
    
    				LUISE
    		I did not altogether. And I was 
    		stranded in a little Swiss village.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Actress?
    
    				LUISE
    			(nods)
    		Singer.
    
    	The telephone bell rings.
    
    140	LUISE watches as Brazil rises and moves unhurriedly 
    	into the bedroom. His unemotional voice comes out: 
    
    				BRAZIL (o.s.)
    		Hello? ... Yes, Evelyn ... Yes.
    			(a long pause)
    		Yes, all right, and thanks.
    
    	Brazil returns to the main room as unhurriedly as 
    	he had left, but at the sight of him Luise half 
    	rises. 
    
    141	BRAZIL's face is pasty, yellow, glistening with sweat 
    	on forehead and temples, and the cigarette between 
    	the fingers of his right hand is mashed and broken.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		That was Evelyn. Her father's 
    		justice of the peace. Conroy's got 
    		a fractured skull -- dying. Robson 
    		just phoned he's going down to swear 
    		out a warrant. That damned 
    		fireplace. 
     
    142	LUISE comes to him with her hands out. 
    
    				LUISE
    		But you are not to blame. They 
    		can't -- 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		You don't get it ...
    
    143	BRAZIL turns away from her toward the front door, 
    	walking mechanically. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		This is what they sent me up for
    		the other time. It was a drunken 
    		free-for-all in a roadhouse, with 
    		bottles and everything, and a guy 
    		died. I couldn't say they were 
    		wrong in tying it on me.
     
    	He opens the door, makes his automatic pretense of 
    	looking out, shuts the door, and moves back toward her.
    
    144	BRAZIL AND LUISE
    
    				BRAZIL
    		It was manslaughter that time. 
    		They'll make it murder if this guy 
    		dies. See? I'm on record as a 
    		killer.
    			(puts a hand up to his chin)
    		It's airtight.
    
    	Luise stands close to him and takes one of his hands.
    
    				LUISE
    		No, no. It was an accident that his 
    		head struck the fireplace. I can 
    		tell them that. I can tell them 
    		what brought it all about. They 
    		cannot-- 
    
    	He laughs with bitter amusement, and quotes Grant: 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		"The strumpet's word confirms the 
    		convict's." 
    
    	She looks grave.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		That's what they'll do to me. If he 
    		dies I haven't got a chance. If he 
    		doesn't, they'll hold me without
    		bail till they see how it's coming 
    		out -- assault with intent to kill 
    		or murder. What good'll your word 
    		be? Robson's mistress leaving him 
    		with me? Tell the truth and it'll
    		only make it worse. They've got me.
    
    	His eyes jerk around toward the door. Then he raises 
    	his head with a rasping noise in his throat that 
    	might be a laugh. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Let's get out of here. I'll go 
    		screwy indoors tonight.
    
    				LUISE
    			(eagerly)
    		Yes. We will go.
    
    	She puts a hand on his shoulder, watching his face 
    	with eyes half frightened, half pitying. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		You'll need a coat.
    
    	He heads into the bedroom.
    
    145	LUISE finds her slippers, puts on the right one, and 
    	holds the left one out to Brazil as he returns. 
    
    				LUISE
    		Will you break off the heel? 
    
    146	BRAZIL drapes the overcoat he carries over Luise's 
    	shoulders, takes the slipper from her, wrenches
    	off the heel with a turn of his wrist and hands it 
    	back to her. He moves toward the front door and 
    	exits. 
    
    147	LUISE puts her foot in the slipper, moves to the 
    	front door, glances swiftly once around the room and 
    	exits, closing the door behind her.
    
    					FADE OUT
     
    	FADE IN:
    148	INT. BRAZIL'S AUTOMOBILE - EARLY NEXT MORNING
    	In the passenger seat, LUISE awakens and opens her 
    	eyes, squinting in the daylight. 
    
    149	The auto's WINDOWS AND WINDSHIELD AND HOOD have been 
    	rained on but the wipers are not in use. Beyond them 
    	is a country road down which the auto (a coupe) 
    	travels.
    
    150	Without moving much, LUISE looks at:
    
    151	BRAZIL who sits low and lax on the seat beside her, 
    	one hand on the steering wheel, the other holding 
    	a cigarette on his knee. His face is placid and there 
    	is no weariness in it. His eyes are steady on the 
    	road ahead.
    
    				LUISE (o.s.)
    		Have I slept long?
    
    	He smiles at her. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		An hour this time. Feel better?
    
    	He raises the hand holding the cigarette to switch 
    	off the headlights.
    
    152	LUISE sits up a little, yawning.
    
    				LUISE 
    		Yes. Will we be much longer? 
    
    153	BRAZIL AND LUISE
    
    				BRAZIL
    		An hour or so.
    
    	He puts a hand in his pocket and offers her
    	cigarettes. She takes one, leans forward and uses 
    	the electric lighter in the dashboard. 
    
    				LUISE
    		What will you do?
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Hide out till I see what's what.
    
    	She glances sidewise at his placid face.
    
    				LUISE
    		You too feel better.
    
    	He grins somewhat shamefacedly. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		I lost my head back there, all 
    		right.
    
    	She pats the back of his hand once, gently.
    
    				LUISE
    		We are going to those friends of 
    		whom you spoke?
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Yes.
    
    154	LUISE watches the road ahead with alarm as ...
    
    155	... a POLICE CAR with two uniformed policemen in it 
    	comes toward them on the opposite side of the road.
    
    156	LUISE looks sharply at:
    
    157	BRAZIL whose face is expressionless. 
    
    158	LUISE screws her head around to follow ...
    
    159	... the POLICE CAR passing and disappearing 
    	from sight.
    
    160	LUISE and BRAZIL
    	She touches his hand again, approvingly.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(explaining)
    		I'm all right outdoors. It's walls 
    		that get me.
    			(off the police)
    		They didn't mean anything.
    
    	He lowers the window on his side and drops his 
    	cigarette out. Fresh air blows in and Brazil breathes 
    	deeply.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Want to stop for coffee?
    
    				LUISE
    		Had we better?
    
    161 	LUISE looks behind her to see ...
    
    162	... a black SEDAN overtaking them.
    
    163	The sedan crowds Brazil's AUTOMOBILE to the edge of 
    	the road in passing, and quickly shoots ahead, 
    	traveling well over the speed limit. 
    
    164	LUISE watches the sedan pass and sees ...
    
    165	... four men in the SEDAN, one of whom looks back at 
    	Brazil's car.
    
    166	LUISE and BRAZIL
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(unconcerned)
    		Maybe it'd be safer to get under 
    		cover as soon as we can; but if 
    		you're hungry-- 
    
    				LUISE
    			(staring at the sedan)
    		No. I too think we should hurry.
    
    167	LUISE'S POV: 
    	The SEDAN disappears around a bend in the road.
    
    168	LUISE and BRAZIL
    
    				LUISE
    		If the police should find you, 
    		would -- would you fight?
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(gloomily)
    		I don't know. That's what's the 
    		matter with me. I never know ahead 
    		of time what I'll do. 
    			(brightening)
    		There's no use worrying. I'll be 
    		all right.
    
    169	EXT. BRAZIL'S AUTO - DAY
    	The AUTO passes through a crossroads settlement of a 
    	dozen houses ...
    
    170	... bumps over railroad tracks ...
    
    171	... and turns into a long straight stretch of road 
    	paralleling the tracks. 
    
    172	LUISE'S POV:
    	Halfway down the level stretch, the SEDAN that had 
    	passed them is parked on the edge of the road. A
    	policeman stands beside it -- between it and his 
    	motorcycle -- and stolidly writes on a leaf of a 
    	small book while the man at the sedan's wheel 
    	talks and gestures excitedly.
    
    173	INT. BRAZIL'S AUTO - CONTINUOUS
    	Luise and Brazil exchange relieved grins.
    
    					DISSOLVE TO:
    
    174	INT. BRAZIL'S AUTO - LATER
    	Brazil and Luise travel down a suburban street.
    
    				LUISE
    		They -- your friends will not 
    		dislike our coming to them like 
    		this?
    
    				BRAZIL
    		No, they've been through things 
    		themselves.
    
    	Luise looks out her window at ...
    
    175	... the HOUSES along the suburban street: cheap and 
    	mean. 
    
    					DISSOLVE TO:
    
    176	LUISE'S POV as the car turns into a shabby city 
    	street where grimy buildings with cards saying 
    	"Flats to Let" in their windows stand among equally 
    	grimy factories and warehouses. 
     
    177	EXT. BRAZIL'S AUTO
    	The car stops in front of a four-story red brick 
    	building with broken brownstone steps. 
    
    178	INT. BRAZIL'S AUTO
    	Brazil and Luise regard the building.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		This is it.
    
    	Luise stares at the building's unlovely face as Brazil 
    	gets out and walks around the car, opening the door 
    	on her side. 
    
    179	EXT. STREET
    	LUISE gets out. Her face is inscrutable as she sees ...
    
    180	... three dirty CHILDREN who stop playing with the 
    	skeleton of an umbrella to stare at ...
    
    181	... LUISE as she goes with Brazil up the broken steps.
    
    182	The street door opens when BRAZIL turns the knob, 
    	letting them into ...
    
    183	INT. BUILDING
    	... a stuffy HALLWAY where a dim light illuminates 
    	stained wallpaper of a once-vivid design, ragged 
    	carpet, and a worn brassbound staircase.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Next floor.
    
    	Luise goes up the stairs, Brazil behind her.
    
    184	Facing the head of the stairs is a DOOR shiny with 
    	new paint. Brazil and Luise stand at this door. Brazil
    	pushes the bell button four times -- long, short, 
    	long, short. The bell rings noisily just inside the 
    	door. After a moment of silence, vague rustling 
    	noises come through the door, followed by a cautious 
    	masculine voice: 
    
    				VOICE
    		Who's there?
    
    	Brazil puts his head close to the door and keeps his 
    	voice low: 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Brazil.
     
    	The fastenings of the door rattle. A small man of 
    	about forty in crumpled pajamas and bare feet opens
    	the door, smiling. 
    
    				SMALL MAN
    		Come in, kid. Come in.
    
    	His eyes appraise Luise from head to foot while he 
    	steps back to make way for them. Brazil puts a hand 
    	on Luise's arm and urges her forward.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Miss Fischer, this is Mr. Link.
    
    				LINK
    		Pleased to meet you.
    
    	Luise bows to him. Link shuts the door behind them. 
    
    185	INT. FLAT 
    	FULL SHOT - Link slaps Brazil on the shoulder. 
    
    				LINK
    		I'm glad to see you, kid. We were 
    		wondering what had happened to you. 
    		Come on in.
    
    	Link leads them into a living room. Articles of 
    	clothing lie around, sheets of newspaper here and 
    	there, a few not quite empty glasses and coffee cups, 
    	and a great many cigarette stubs. 
    
    	Link takes a vest off a chair and throws it across 
    	the back of another.
    
    				LINK
    		Take off your things and set down, 
    		Miss Fischer.
    
    	Luise takes off her coat as ...
    
    186	... a blonde full-bodied WOMAN in her late twenties, 
    	wearing a pink wrapper over a pink silk nightgown and 
    	green mules decorated with yellow feathers, runs to 
    	Brazil with wide arms, hugs him violently and kisses 
    	him on the mouth.

    		Fan, this is Miss Fischer, Mrs. Link.

    				FAN
    			(shaking hands warmly)
    		Glad to know you. You look tired, 
    		both of you. Sit down and I'll get

    				BRAZIL
    			(sitting on sofa)
    		Yes. Driving most of it. 
    
    	Fan looks sharply at him. 
    
    				FAN
    		Anything the matter you'd just as 
    		lief tell me about? 
    
    	Brazil nods. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		That's what we came for.
    
    	Link, in bathrobe and slippers now, comes in with a 
    	bottle of whiskey and some glasses.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		The thing is, I slapped a guy down 
    		last night and he didn't get up.
    
    				FAN
    		Hurt bad?
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Maybe dying.
    
    	Link whistles.

    		When you slap 'em, boy, they stay 
    		slapped.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(scowls at Link)
    		He cracked his head on the fireplace.
    
    				FAN
    		Well, there's no sense worrying 
    		about it now. The thing to do is
    		get something in your stomachs and 
    		get some rest. Come on, Donny, pry 
    		yourself loose from some of that 
    		booze.
    			(to Luise) 
    		You just sit still and I'll have 
    		some breakfast in no time at all.
    
    	Fan hurries out of the room.
    
    188	LINK, BRAZIL AND LUISE
    	Link pours whiskey. Link looks at Luise whenever 
    	she's not looking at him. 
    
    				LINK

    				BRAZIL
    			(nods)
    		Uh-huh -- the wrong people.

    	Luise sips and coughs. 
    
    				LINK
    		Want a chaser?
    
    				LUISE
    		No, I thank you. This is very good. 
    		I caught a little cold from the 
    		rain.
     
    	She holds the glass in her hand, but does not drink 
    	again.
    
    191	LINK, BRAZIL AND LUISE
    
    				BRAZIL

    		Sure.
    
    195	LINK, BRAZIL AND LUISE
    	Link goes to a telephone in an alcove and calls a 
    	number. Brazil empties his glass and looks at Luise. 
    
    				BRAZIL 
    		Tired?
    
    196	LUISE AND BRAZIL
    	Luise rises, goes over to him, takes the whiskey glass 
    	out of his hand, and puts it on the table with her 
    	own, which is still almost full.
    
    				BRAZIL 
    			(chuckles)
    		Had enough trouble with drunks last 
    		night?
    
    				LUISE
    			(unsmiling)
    		Yes.
    
    	Luise returns to her chair.
       
    197	LINK, BRAZIL AND LUISE
    	Luise and Brazil regard each other silently while, in 
    	the background, Link speaks into the telephone.
    
    				LINK
    		Hello, Duke? ... Listen, this is 
    		Donny. There's a ride standing 
    		outside my joint. Will you stash it 
    		for me? ... Yes, right out front 
    		... Better switch the plates too. 
    		... Yes, right away, will you? ... 
    		Right.
     
    	Link hangs up the receiver and turns back to the 
    	others.
    
    				LINK
    		Voily!
    
    	Fan's voice calls from elsewhere in the flat.
    
    				FAN
    		Donny!
    
    				LINK
    		Coming! 
    
    	Link goes out.
    
    198	BRAZIL AND LUISE
    	Brazil leans toward Luise and speaks in a low voice. 
    	She puts her face close to his.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Don't give him the rings.
    
    	She stares at him in surprise. 
    
    				LUISE
    		But why?
    
    				BRAZIL
    		He'll gyp you to hell and gone.
    
    				LUISE
    		You mean he will cheat me?
    
    	Brazil nods, grinning.
    
    				LUISE
    		But you say he is your friend. You 
    		are trusting him now.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		He's okay on a deal like this. He'd 
    		never turn anybody up. But dough's 
    		different. Anyhow, even if he didn't 
    		trim you, anybody he sold them to 
    		would think they were stolen and 
    		wouldn't give half of what they're 
    		worth.
    
    				LUISE
    		Then he is a ...? 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		A crook. We were cellmates a while.
     
    				LUISE
    			(frowning) 
    		I do not like this.
    
    	In the b.g., Fan comes to the door, smiling.
    
    				FAN
    		Breakfast is served.
    
    					CUT TO:
    
    199	DINING ROOM - LATER
    	Brazil, Luise and Link sit at a table, eating. Fan is absent.
    
    				LINK
    			(mouth full)
    		Now, for instance, you take the 
    		case of Shuffling Ben Devlin. You 
    		remember Ben? He was in the 
    		carpenter shop. Remember? The big 
    		guy with the gam?
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(unenthusiastic) 
    		I remember.
    
    				LINK
    		Well, Ben was in a place called 
    		Finehaven once and--
    
    				BRAZIL
    		He was in a place called the pen 
    		when we knew him.
    
    				LINK
    		Sure, that's what I'm telling you. 
    		It was all on account of Ben thought
    		he wouldn't need no getaway stake.
    		That's why I say, if you're gonna 
    		sell them rings, I can--
    
    				BRAZIL
    		That can wait. We've got enough to 
    		go on a while.
    
    				LINK
    		Maybe, but it's just as well to 
    		have a getaway stake ready in case 
    		you need it all of a sudden. And 
    		you can't have too big a one. 
    
    	Fan comes in. 
    
    				FAN
    			(to Luise)
    		Got you a hot bath ready and fixed 
    		your bed, 'cause I know you're all 
    		in and'll be ready to fall over as 
    		soon as you're done. Everything's 
    		ready whenever you are.
       
    	Luise puts down her coffee cup and rises. 
    
    				LUISE
    		It is a lovely breakfast but I am 
    		too tired to eat much.
    
    	Link watches Luise as she and Fan exit. Brazil
    	sits silently, looking at his food. After a moment,
    	Link looks over at Brazil and, as if imparting one of
    	the Darkest Secrets of the Known Universe, says:
    
    				LINK
    		Shuffling Ben Devlin.
    
    	Brazil gives him a look. Link nods. Brazil rolls his 
    	eyes.
    
    					CUT TO:
    
    200	BEDROOM - in the rear of the flat. A wide wooden bed 
    	with smooth white covers turned down. A white 
    	nightgown and a red wrapper lie on the bed. On the 
    	floor: a pair of slippers. Fan and Luise stand in 
    	the door. 
    
    				FAN
    		If there's anything else you need, 
    		just sing out. The bathroom's just 
    		across the hall and I turned the 
    		water on.
    
    				LUISE
    		Thank you, you are very kind. I am 
    		imposing on you most.
    
    	Fan pats her shoulder. 
    
    				FAN
    		No friend of Brazil's can ever 
    		impose on me, darling. Now, you get 
    		your bath and a good sleep, and if 
    		there's anything you want, yell.
    
    	She goes out and shuts the door. Luise, standing just 
    	inside the door, looks slowly, carefully around the 
    	cheaply furnished room, and then, going to the side 
    	of the bed, begins to take off her clothes. 
    
    201	LUISE, wearing the red wrapper and the slippers and 
    	carrying the nightgown over her arm, crosses the 
    	hallway to the bathroom. 
    
    202	The BATHROOM - warm with steam. Luise runs cold water 
    	into the tub while she takes the bandages off her 
    	knee and ankle.
    
    203	LUISE in the tub, eyes closed.
    
    204	After bathing, LUISE finds fresh bandages in the 
    	cabinet over the basin.
    
    205	LUISE rewraps her knee (but not her ankle). 
    
    206	LUISE, wearing nightgown, wrapper, and slippers, 
    	returns to the bedroom. As she enters, she pauses at 
    	the sight of:
    
    207	BRAZIL, standing with his back to her, looking out a 
    	window. He does not turn around. Smoke from his 
    	cigarette drifts back past his head. 
    
    208	LUISE shuts the door slowly and leans against it, the 
    	faintest of contemptuous smiles curving her mobile 
    	lips. 
    
    209	BRAZIL does not move.
    
    210	LUISE goes slowly to the bed and sits on the side 
    	farthest from him. She does not look at him but at a 
    	picture of a horse on the wall. Her face is proud and 
    	cold. 
    
    				LUISE
    		I am what I am, but I pay my debts. 
    		I brought this trouble to you. Well, 
    		now, if you can find any use for 
    		me --  
    
    	She shrugs.
    
    211	BRAZIL turns from the window without haste. His eyes 
    	and face are expressionless. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Okay.
    
    	He rubs the fire of his cigarette out in an ashtray 
    	on the dressing table and comes around the bed to 
    	her.
    
    212	BRAZIL AND LUISE   
    	She stands up straight and tall, awaiting him. He 
    	stands close to her for a moment, looking at her with 
    	eyes that weigh her beauty as impersonally as if she 
    	were inanimate. Then he pushes her head back rudely 
    	and kisses her. She makes neither sound nor movement 
    	of her own, submitting completely to his caress, and 
    	when he releases her and steps back, her face is as 
    	unaffected, as mask-like, as his. He shakes his head 
    	slowly. 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		No, you're no good at your job.
    
    	She laughs softly and falls into his arms. He kisses 
    	her mouth and cheeks and eyes and forehead.
    
    213	LINK opens the door and comes in. He leers knowingly 
    	at ...
    
    214	... BRAZIL and LUISE as they step apart.
    
    215	LINK grins.
    
    				LINK
    		I just phoned Klaus. He'll be over 
    		in a few minutes.
    
    				BRAZIL (o.s.)
    		Okay. Thanks.
    
    	Link, still leering, withdraws, shutting the door.
    
    216	BRAZIL AND LUISE
    
    				LUISE
    		Who is this Klaus?
    
    				BRAZIL 
    			(absent-mindedly)
    		Lawyer.
    			(scowls thoughtfully 
    			at floor)
    		I guess he's our best bet, though 
    		I've heard things about him that-- 
    			(abruptly) 
    		When you're in a jam you have to 
    		take your chances. And the best you 
    		can expect is the worst of it.
     
    	She takes his hand.
    
    				LUISE
    		Let us go away from here. I do not 
    		like these people. I do not trust 
    		them.
    
    	His face clears and he puts an arm around her again, 
    	but turns his attention to the door when the 
    	doorbell rings beyond it. They freeze up.
    
    				LINK (o.s.)
    			(guarded)
    		Who is it?
    
    	The answer cannot be heard. 
    
    				LINK (o.s.)
    			(a little louder) 
    		Who?
    
    	A long pause.
    
    217	At the DOOR, a creaking floorboard breaks the silence 
    	just outside the bedroom door. Link opens the door, 
    	his pinched face a caricature of alertness. 
    
    				LINK
    			(whispers)
    		Bulls. Take the window.
    
    218	BRAZIL AND LUISE
    	Luise pushes Brazil toward the window.
    
    				LUISE
    		Go! I will be all right.
    
    219	Link joins them as ALL THREE move to the window.
    
    				LINK
    		Sure. Me and Fan'll take care of 
    		her. Beat it, kid, and slip us the 
    		word when you can. Got enough 
    		dough? 
    
    				BRAZIL
    		Uh-huh.
    
    	Brazil stops to kiss Luise.
    
    				LUISE
    			(gasps)
    		Go, go! 
    
    220	BRAZIL, as phlegmatic as ever, is at the window.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(laconic) 
    		Be seeing you.
    
    	He pushes up the window. His foot is over the sill by 
    	the time the window is completely raised. His other 
    	foot follows the first immediately, and, turning on 
    	his chest, he lowers himself, grinning cheerfully at 
    	Luise for an instant before he drops out of sight.
    
    221	LUISE runs to the window and looks down at... 
    
    222	... BRAZIL rising from among weeds in the unkempt 
    	back yard. His head turns quickly from right to left. 
    	Moving with a swiftness that seems mere unhesitancy, 
    	he goes to the left-hand fence, up it, and over into 
    	the next-door yard.
    
    223	LINK AND LUISE
    	Link takes her arm and pulls her from the window. 
    
    				LINK
    		Stay away from there. You'll tip 
    		his mitt. He's all right, though 
    		Christ help the copper he runs into 
    		-- if they're close.
    
    	Something heavy pounds on the flat's front door. A 
    	heavy, authoritative voice comes through: 
    
    				VOICE (o.s.)
    		Open up! 
    
    	Link sneers in the general direction of the front door. 
    
    				LINK
    			(lightly)
    		I guess I better let 'em in or 
    		they'll be making toothpicks of my 
    		front gate.
    
    	Luise stares at him with blank eyes. He seems to be 
    	enjoying the situation. He looks at her, looks at 
    	the floor and at her again.
    
    				LINK
    			(defensively)
    		Look -- I love the guy. I love him!
    
    	The pounding on the front door becomes louder.
    
    				VOICE (o.s.)
    		Open up! 
    
    				LINK
    		I guess I better.
    
    	Link goes out.
    
    224	Through the open window comes the sound of a shot. 
    	LUISE runs to the window and, hands on sill, leans 
    	far out. She sees:
    
    225	Fifty feet to the left, on the top of a fence that 
    	divides the long row of back yards from the alley 
    	behind, BRAZIL, poised, crouching. Another shot 
    	sounds and Brazil falls down out of sight into the 
    	alley behind the fence. 
    
    226	LUISE catches her breath with a sob. The pounding on 
    	the flat's front door suddenly stops.
    
    227	LUISE draws her head in through the window. She takes 
    	her hands from the sill. Her face is an automaton's.  
    	She pulls the window down without seeming conscious 
    	of what she's doing. 
    
    228	A tired-faced HUGE MAN in wrinkled clothes appears in 
    	the doorway and sees ...
    
    229	... LUISE standing in the center of the room, looking 
    	critically at her fingernails.
    
    230	The HUGE MAN eyes LUISE.
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		Where's he at?
    
    	She looks up at him with the same expression she uses 
    	on her fingernails. 
    
    				LUISE
    		Who?
    
    				HUGE MAN
    			(sighs wearily)
    		Brazil.
    
    	He moves to a closet door, opens it. 
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		You the Fischer woman?
    
    	He shuts the door and moves toward the window, 
    	looking around the room, not at her, with little 
    	apparent interest.
    
    				LUISE
    		I am Luise Fischer.
       
    231	The HUGE MAN raises the window and leans out, calling 
    	to someone below.  
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		How's it, Tom?
    
    	Whatever answer he receives is inaudible in the room.
    	
    232	The HUGE MAN turns and moves uncomfortably close to 
    	LUISE. 
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		I ain't had breakfast yet.
    
    	They regard one another unflinchingly throughout the 
    	following:
    
    	Link's voice comes through the doorway from another 
    	part of the flat:
    
    				LINK (o.s.)
    		I tell you I don't know where he's 
    		gone to. He just dropped the dame 
    		here and hightailed. He didn't tell 
    		me nothing. He -- 
    
    				A METALLIC VOICE (o.s.)
    			(disagreeably)
    		I bet you!
    
    	The sound of a blow.
    
    				LINK (o.s.)
    		If I did know I wouldn't tell you, 
    		you big crum! Now sock me again.
    
    				METALLIC VOICE (o.s.)
    		If that's what you want.
    
    	The sound of another blow.
     
    				FAN (o.s.)
    			(shrill with anger)
    		Stop that, you --
    
    233	The HUGE MAN goes to the bedroom door and calls
    	toward the front of the flat: 
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		Never mind, Ray.
    
    234	The HUGE MAN re-joins LUISE.
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		Get some clothes on.
    
    				LUISE
    			(coolly)
    		Why?
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		They want you back in Mile Valley.
    
    				LUISE
    		For what?
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		I don't know. This ain't my job. 
    		We're just picking you up for them. 
    		Something about some rings that 
    		belonged to a guy's mother and 
    		disappeared from the house the 
    		same time you did.
    
    	She holds up her hands and stares at the rings. 
    
    				LUISE
    		But they didn't. He bought them 
    		for me in Paris and -- 
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		Well, don't argue with me about it. 
    		It's none of my business. Where was 
    		this fellow Brazil meaning to go 
    		when he left here?
     
    				LUISE
    		I do not know.
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		Nobody ever does.
    
    				LUISE
    		Is he --?
    
    				HUGE MAN
    			(interrupts)
    		Get your clothes on. Better let me 
    		take care of the junk.
    
    	He holds his hand out. She hesitates, then slips the 
    	rings from her fingers and drops them into his hand.
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		Shake it up. I ain't had breakfast 
    		yet.
    
    	He goes out and shuts the door.
    
    235	Alone, LUISE kicks off her slippers and strips off 
    	her nightgown and wrapper, revealing her pale body.
    	She dresses hurriedly in the clothes she had taken 
    	off a short while before, save for the one stocking 
    	she had worn down from Brazil's house. 
    
    236	Fully dressed, she goes quietly, with a backward 
    	glance at the closed door, to the window, and begins 
    	slowly, cautiously, to raise the sash. She turns in
    	time to see...
    
    237	... the tired-faced HUGE MAN opening the door. 
    
    238	LUISE stares at him.
    
    239	The HUGE MAN stares back.
    
    				HUGE MAN
    			(patiently)
    		Good thing I was peeping through 
    		the keyhole. Now come on.
    
    240	LUISE glares at him contemptuously.
    
    241	FAN comes into the room behind the HUGE MAN. 
    
    				FAN
    			(shrill)
    		What're you picking on her for? 
    		She didn't do anything. Why don't 
    		you -- 
    
    				HUGE MAN
    			(wearily)
    		Stop it, stop it. I'm only a copper 
    		told to bring her in on a larceny 
    		charge. I got nothing to do with 
    		it, don't know anything about it.
    
    242	LUISE joins FAN and the HUGE MAN.
    
    				LUISE
    			(with dignity)
    		It is all right, Mrs. Link. It will 
    		be all right.
    
    				FAN
    		But you can't go like that.
    			(to the huge man)
    		You got to let her put on some 
    		decent clothes.
    
    				HUGE MAN
    			(sighs and nods)
    		Anything, if you'll only hurry it 
    		up and stop arguing with me.
    
    	Fan hurries out.
    
    243	LUISE and the HUGE MAN.
    
    				LUISE
    		Brazil too is charged with larceny? 
    
    				HUGE MAN
    			(spiritlessly)
    		Maybe one thing, maybe another.
    
    				LUISE
    		He has done nothing.
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		Well, I haven't neither.
    
    	FAN comes in with some clothes, a blue suit and hat, 
    	dark slippers, stockings, and a white blouse. The HUGE 
    	MAN looks them over.
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		Just keep the door open.
    
    	He goes out of the room and stands leaning against an 
    	opposite wall, where he can see the windows in the 
    	bedroom. 
    
    					PAN OVER TO:
    
    244	A CORNER OF THE ROOM hidden from the HUGE MAN, where
    	LUISE changes her clothes, with FAN's assistance.
    
    				FAN
    			(whispers)
    		Did they catch him?
     
    				LUISE

    	and puts it on; then, smoothing down the suit, looks 
    	at her reflection. The clothes do not fit her so badly

    	more adults and children stand around it, solemnly 
    	watching Luise. A uniformed POLICEMAN pushes some of 
    	them aside to make passageway for her and the huge 
    	man.
    
    253	LUISE maintains her dignity as she gets into the car.

    	globes into the building ...
    
    257	... and into a room where a fat BALD MAN in uniform 
    	sits behind a high desk. 
    
    				HUGE MAN
    		It's that Luise Fischer for Mile

    262	LUISE follows LUKE down a bare corridor to the far 
    	end, where he opens a door and stands aside for her to 
    	go through. 
    
    263	The SMALL ROOM into which the door opens - furnished 
    	with cot, table, two chairs, and some magazines. Also,

    	LUISE lies on the cot, slippers off, staring at the

    	Luke stands aside to let two PLAINCLOTHESMEN enter. 
    	Both wear dull clothes, one thick-chested and florid, 
    	the other less heavy, older. The thick-chested, 
    	florid one grins admiringly at ...

    				OLD PLAINCLOTHESMAN (o.s.)
    		We want you to come back to the

    	The older man, addressing the man at the wheel, 
    	interrupts.
    
    				OLD PLAINCLOTHESMAN 
    		Let it alone, Pete. Let the D.A. do 
    		his own work.
    
    				THICK PLAINCLOTHESMAN 
    		Oke.
    
    270	LUISE turns to the OLD PLAINCLOTHESMAN beside her.

    		Was -- was Brazil hurt?
    
    	He studies her face for a long moment, then nods 
    	slightly. 
    
    				OLD PLAINCLOTHESMAN
    		Stopped a slug, I hear.
    
    				LUISE
    			(eyes widening)
    		He was shot?

    	A ground-floor room in the gray building. Three men 
    	in the room: A sad-faced desk man. A pasty-faced

    	far past thirty, flashily dressed, who stands with his 
    	back to the window. 
    
    				PASTY FACE

    		Don't worry. I've got everything fixed.

    	Klaus picks up a brown briefcase from a chair, takes 
    	Luise's elbow in his hand, and turns her to follow the 
    	thick plainclothesman.
    
    279	The THICK PLAINCLOTHESMAN leads KLAUS and LUISE down 
    	the corridor a few feet to an office similar to the 
    	one they've just left. He does not go in with them. 
    
    				THICK PLAINCLOTHESMAN	
    		Come on back when you're finished.
    
    	When they've gone in, he slams the door.

    	Klaus jerks his head at the door. 
    
    				KLAUS

    		Brazil? He is -- ?
    
    	His shrug lifts his shoulders almost to his ears. 
    
    				KLAUS
    		I don't know. Can't get anything 
    		out of these people.
    
    				LUISE
    		Then?
    
    				KLAUS
    		Then he got away.

    	He shrugs his shoulders again. 
    
    				KLAUS

    		That don't have to mean anything 
    		but that they hope they hit him.
    
    	He puts his hands on her shoulders and pushes her 
    	down into a chair. 
    
    281	KLAUS AND LUISE
    	He draws another chair up close to hers and sits in 
    	it.
    
    				KLAUS
    		There's no use of worrying about 
    		Brazil till we know whether we've 
    		got anything to worry about. Let's 
    		worry about you now. I want the 
    		works -- no song and dance -- just 
    		what happened the way it happened.
    
    	She draws her brows together in a puzzled frown. 
    
    				LUISE
    		But you told me everything -- 
    
    				KLAUS
    		I told you everything was all 
    		fixed, and it is.
    			(pats her knee)
    		I've got the bail all fixed so you 
    		can walk out of here as soon as

    			(beat)
    		You want to help Brazil, don't you?
    
    				LUISE
    		Yes.
    
    				KLAUS
    		That's the stuff.
    
    	He pats her knee again, and his hand remains on it. 
    
    				KLAUS
    		Now, give me everything, from the 
    		beginning.
    
    				LUISE
    		You mean from when I first met Kane 
    		Robson?
    
    	He nods. She crosses her knees, dislodging his hand. 
    	She stares at the opposite wall as if not seeing it. 
    
    				LUISE
    		Neither of us did anything wrong. It 
    		is not right that we should suffer.
    
    				KLAUS
    			(light, confident)
    		Don't worry. I'll get the pair of 
    		you out of it. 
    
    	He offers her cigarettes in a shiny case. She takes a 
    	cigarette, leans forward to hold its end to the flame 
    	from his lighter.
    
    				LUISE
    		I will not have to stay here 
    		tonight?
    
    				KLAUS
    		I don't think so. It oughtn't to 
    		take them more than an hour to 
    		grill you...
    
    	He drops his hand to her knee. 
    
    				KLAUS
    		... and the sooner we get through 
    		here, the sooner you'll be through 
    		with them.
    
    	She takes a deep breath and sits back in her chair. 
    
    				LUISE
    		There is not a lot to say. I met 
    		him in a little place in 
    		Switzerland. I was without any 
    		money at all, any friends. He liked 
    		me and he was rich.
    			(gestures with the cigarette) 
    		So I said yes.
    
    	Klaus nods sympathetically and his fingers move on 
    	her knee. 
    
    				LUISE
    		He bought me clothes, those jewels, 
    		in Paris. They were not his mother's 
    		and he gave them to me.
    
    	Klaus nods again and his fingers move again on her 
    	knee.
    
    				LUISE
    		He brought me over here then 
    		and ...
     
    	Luise casually puts the burning end of her cigarette 
    	on the back of Klaus' hand.
    
    				LUISE
    		... I stayed at his -- 
    
    	Klaus snatches his hand from her knee to his mouth
    	and starts sucking the back of his hand. 
    
    				KLAUS
    			(muffled by the hand 
    			to his mouth)
    		What's the matter with you?! 
    
    	He lowers the hand and looks at the burn. 
    
    				KLAUS
    		If there's something you don't 
    		like, you can say so, can't you?! 
    
    				LUISE
    			(unsmiling)
    		I no speak Inglis good.

    		I stayed at his house for two weeks 
    		-- not quite two weeks -- until -- 
    
    				KLAUS
    			(talking over her)
    		If it wasn't for Brazil, you could 
    		take your troubles to another 
    		lawyer! 
    
    				LUISE
    			(calmly)
    		... until last night, when I could

    		They're getting impatient.
    
    283	LUISE rises from her chair.
    
    				LUISE
    		I have finished. Then the police

    		those rings.
    
    				KLAUS (o.s.)
    		Did you do any talking after they 
    		arrested you?

    		He hathn't come to yet. They don't 
    		know yet how bad it ith.
    
    				KLAUS
    		Where is he?
    
    				YOUNG MAN
    		Thtill at Robthon'th. They're 
    		afraid to move him.
    
    	They turn a corner. 
    
    				KLAUS
    		Any news of Brazil? 
    
    				YOUNG MAN
    		I thought you'd know.
    
    				KLAUS
    		Know what?
    
    				YOUNG MAN
    		What -- whatever there wath to know. 
    		Thith ith it.
    
    	The young man leads them into a white-tiled 
    	restaurant.
    
    286	INT. RESTAURANT
    	By the time they are seated at a table, the dozen or 
    	more people at the counter and tables are staring at 
    	Luise and whispering among themselves.
    
    287	LUISE, sitting in a chair the young man pulls out for 
    	her, taking one of the menus from the rack on the 
    	table, seems neither disturbed by nor conscious of 
    	anyone's interest in her. 
    
    				LUISE
    		I am very hungry.
    
    288	As they sit, KLAUS and the YOUNG MAN look at LUISE, 
    	each other, and their menus.
    
    289	A PLUMP MAN with a beard, sitting three tables away, 
    	catches the young man's eye and beckons with a jerk 
    	of his head.
    
    290	The YOUNG MAN rises.
    
    				YOUNG MAN
    		Pardon me -- it'th my both.
    
    	He goes over to the plump man's table.
     
    291	KLAUS AND LUISE
    	Klaus watches the young man go.
    
    				KLAUS
    		He's a nice boy.
    
    				LUISE
    		We must telephone the Links. They 
    		have surely heard from Brazil.
    
    				KLAUS
    			(frowns)
    		You can't trust these county-seat 
    		telephone exchanges.
    
    				LUISE
    		But --  
    
    				KLAUS
    		Have to wait till tomorrow. It's 
    		late anyhow.
    
    	He looks at his watch and yawns. 
    
    				KLAUS
    		Play this kid. Maybe he knows 
    		something.
    
    	Klaus inspects his menu as Luise stares at him.
    
    292	THE THREE
    	The YOUNG MAN comes back to them. His face is flushed 
    	and he seems embarrassed.
    
    				KLAUS
    		Anything new?
    
    	The young man shakes his head violently. 
    
    				YOUNG MAN
    			(with emphasis)
    		Oh, no.
    
    	A waiter comes to their table. 
    
    				LUISE
    		Soup, onion. Steak, medium. Mashed
    		potatoes, asparagus, the house salad, 
    		cheese ... and coffee. 
    
    				KLAUS
    		Scrambled eggs ... and coffee.
    
    				YOUNG MAN
    		Apple pie ... and, uh, milk.
    
    	The young man glances at his tablemates sheepishly. 
    	When the waiter steps back from the table, the young 
    	man's eyes open wide.
     
    293	LUISE turns her head to follow the young man's gaze. 
    
    294	FRONT DOOR
    	Kane Robson enters the restaurant with two men. One 
    	of them -- a fat, pale man --- smiles and raises his 
    	hat. 
    
    295	LUISE, without removing her gaze from Robson, 
    	addresses KLAUS in a low voice: 
    
    				LUISE
    		It's Robson.
    
    	Klaus does not turn his head. 
    
    				KLAUS
    		That's all right.
    
    	Klaus holds his cigarette case out to her. Still 
    	staring at Robson, she takes a cigarette. 
    
    296	LUISE'S POV: ROBSON - When he sees Luise, he raises 
    	his hat and bows. Then he says something to his 
    	companions and, leaving them, comes toward her. His 
    	eyes glitter. 
    
    297	Luise is smoking by the time he reaches THE TABLE. 
    
    				ROBSON
    		Hello, darling.
    
    	He sits in the empty chair facing her across the 
    	table. He turns his head to the young man for an 
    	instant.
    
    				ROBSON
    			(carelessly)
    		Hello, Dunne. 
    
    				LUISE
    		This is Mr. Klaus. Mr. Robson.
     
    	Robson does not look at Klaus. 
    
    				ROBSON
    			(to Luise)
    		Get your bail fixed up all right?
    
    				LUISE
    		As you see.
    
    				ROBSON
    			(smiles mockingly)
    		I meant to leave word that I'd put 
    		it up if you couldn't get it 
    		anywhere else, but I forgot.
    
    	There is a moment of silence. 
    
    				LUISE
    		I shall send for my clothes in the 
    		morning. Will you have Ito pack 
    		them?
    
    				ROBSON
    		Your clothes?
    			(laughs)
    		You didn't have a stitch besides 
    		what you had on when I picked you 
    		up. Let your new man buy you new 
    		clothes.
    
    	The young man blushes and looks at the tablecloth in 
    	embarrassment. Klaus's face is, except for the 
    	brightness of his eyes, expressionless. 
    
    				LUISE
    			(softly)
    		Your friends will miss you if you 
    		stay away too long.
    
    				ROBSON
    		Let them. I want to talk to you, 
    		Luise.
    			(impatiently, to the others)
    		Why don't you two go play in a 
    		corner somewhere?
    
    	The young man jumps from his chair, stammering.
    
    				YOUNG MAN
    		Th-thertainly, Mr. Robthon.
    
    	Klaus looks questioningly at Luise. Her nod is barely 
    	perceptible. He rises and leaves the table with the 
    	young man.
    
    298	LUISE AND ROBSON. 
    	Robson slides into a chair next to Luise.
    
    				ROBSON
    		Come back with me and I'll call off 
    		all this foolishness about the rings.
    
    				LUISE
    			(curiously)
    		You want me back, knowing I despise 
    		you?
    
    				ROBSON
    			(nods, grinning)
    		I can get fun out of even that.
    
    	She narrows her eyes, studying his face. 
    
    				LUISE
    		I am told Mr. Conroy is still 
    		unconscious.
    
    				ROBSON
    			(nods, with wry malice)
    		Yeah. He's in a bedroom at my place.
    		And he's not dying fast enough.
    
    				LUISE
    			(surprised)
    		You hate him?
    
    				ROBSON
    		I don't hate him -- I don't love 
    		him. You and he were too fond of 
    		each other. I won't have any male
    		and female parasites mixing like 
    		that.
    
    				LUISE
    			(smiling contemptuously)
    		So. Then suppose I go back with 
    		you. What?
    
    				ROBSON
    		I explain to these people that it 
    		was all a mistake about the rings, 
    		that you really thought I had given 
    		them to you. That's all.
    
    	He watches her closely. 
    
    				ROBSON
    		There's no bargaining about your 
    		boyfriend, Brazil. He takes what he 
    		gets.
    
    	Her face shows nothing of what she might be thinking. 
    	She leans a little toward him. 
    
    				LUISE
    			(carefully)
    		If you were as dangerous as you 
    		think you are, I would be afraid to 
    		go back with you -- I would rather 
    		go to prison. But I am not afraid 
    		of you. You should know by this 
    		time that you will never hurt me 
    		very much, that I can take very 
    		good care of myself.
    
    				ROBSON
    			(quickly)
    		Maybe you've got something to learn.
    
    	Then, recovering his consciously matter-of-fact tone: 
    
    				ROBSON
    		Well, what's the answer?
    
    				LUISE
    		I am not a fool. I have no money, no 
    		friends who can help me. You have 
    		both, and I am not afraid of you. I 
    		try to do what is best for myself. 
    		First I try to get out of this 
    		trouble without you. If I cannot, 
    		then I come back to you.
    
    				ROBSON
    		If I'll have you.
    
    	She shrugs her shoulders. 
    
    				LUISE
    		Yes, certainly that.
     
    	They stare at each other for a long moment.

    		See, I told you Harry would get you

    			(to Klaus)
    		You didn't let them hold her all

    		Brazil had told me about this place 
    		-- and I thought he'd come here and 
    		I tried to phone him and Papa caught

    		She's been doing this for an hour.

    			(nods) 
    		Yep. He's okay.
    
    	Link glances over his shoulder at the girl on the 
    	sofa, then speaks rapidly in a low voice. 
    
    				LINK
    		He's at the Hilltop Sanatorium, 
    		outside of town -- supposed to 
    		have D.T.'s. You know he got plugged 
    		in the side. He's okay, though -- 
    		Doc Barry'll keep him under cover 
    		and fix him up good as new. He -- 
    
    301	LUISE's eyes grow large. She puts a hand to her throat. 
    
    				LUISE
    		But he -- Dr. Ralph Barry? 
    
    302	LUISE, LINK AND KLAUS

    		Yes. He's a good guy. He'll --
    
    				LUISE

    		I met him there, at Robson's house.
    			(turns to Klaus)
    		He was with him in the restaurant 
    		last night, the fat one.
    
    	The men stare at her. She grabs Klaus's arm and shakes 
    	him. 
    
    				LUISE
    		That is why he was there last night 
    		-- to see Kane -- to ask him what 
    		he should do.

    		No chance of a mistake on this?
    
    				LUISE
    		No.
    
    	Evelyn thrusts herself between the two men to confront 
    	Luise. She is crying again, but angry now. 
    
    				EVELYN
    		Why did you have to get him into 
    		all this? Why did you have to come 
    		to him with your troubles? It's 
    		your fault that they'll put him in 
    		prison -- and he'll go crazy in

    		of there. It don't --
    
    				KLAUS

    		That's easy. If this Dr. Barry is

    	ashtray. His eyes glitter in the light from a 
    	fireplace.
    
    324	Ten feet away, partly facing him, partly facing the 
    	fireplace, LUISE sits, more erectly, in a smaller 
    	chair. She wears a pale negligee and pale slippers.
    	A distant window reveals the night sky.
    
    325	ROBSON waits for the clock to stop striking.
    
    				ROBSON
    		And you are making a great mistake, 
    		my dear, in being too sure of 
    		yourself.
    
    326	LUISE yawns. 
    
    				LUISE
    		I slept very little last night. I am 
    		too sleepy to be frightened.
     
    327	ROBSON rises, grinning at her. 
    
    				ROBSON
    		I didn't get any either. Shall we 
    		take a look at the invalid before 
    		we turn in? 
    
    326	A NURSE -- a scrawny middle-aged woman in white -- 
    	comes into the room, panting. 
    
    				NURSE
    		Mr. Robson! Mr. Robson! It's Mr. 
    		Conroy. He's recovering consciousness. 
    
    327	ROBSON's mouth tightens, and his eyes, after a 
    	momentary flickering, became steady. 
    
    328	LUISE watches Robson with concern.
    
    329	ROBSON and the NURSE
    
    				ROBSON
    		Phone Dr. Blake. He'll want to know 
    		right away.
    
    	The nurse nods and leaves. Robson turns to Luise. 
    
    				ROBSON 
    		I'll run up and stay with him till 
    		she is through phoning.
    
    330	LUISE rises.
    
    				LUISE
    		I'll go with you.
    
    331	ROBSON purses his lips. 
    
    				ROBSON 
    		I don't know. Maybe the excitement 
    		of too many people -- the surprise 
    		of seeing you back here again -- 
    		might not be good for him.
    
    332	LUISE stares at Robson incredulously.
    
    333	ROBSON starts out.
    
    				ROBSON 
    		No. I think you'd better stay here.
    
    334	LUISE lowers her brows.
    
    				LUISE
    		I will not.
     
    335	ROBSON pauses, thinks it over, shrugs. 
    
    				ROBSON 
    			(too casually)
    		Suit yourself.
    
    	He leaves the room.
    
    336	LUISE, following, watches as ...
    
    337	... ROBSON walks briskly up the stairs.
    
    338	Concerned, LUISE goes up the stairs behind Robson, 
    	but not with his speed. 
    
    339	LUISE arrives at the sickroom doorway just in time to 
    	see ...
    
    340	... the look of utter fear in CONROY's eyes, before 
    	they close, as his bandaged head falls back on the 
    	pillow. Robson, standing just inside the door, turns 
    	to Luise. 
    
    				ROBSON
    			(softly)
    		Ah, he's passed out again.
    
    	Robson's eyes are unwary. 
    
    341	LUISE's eyes are probing.
    
    342	LUISE AND ROBSON stand there and stare at each other 
    	until ITO, the Japanese butler, comes to the door.
    
    				ITO
    		A Mr. Brazil to see Frulein Fischer.
    
    343	Into ROBSON's face little by little comes the 
    	expression of one considering a private joke. 
    
    				ROBSON
    		Show Mr. Brazil into the living room. 
    		Frulein Fischer will be down 
    		immediately. Phone the deputy 
    		sheriff.
    
    344	ITO nods and leaves as ROBSON smiles at LUISE.
    
    				ROBSON
    		Well?
    
    	Luise says nothing.
      
    				ROBSON
    		A choice?
       
    	The NURSE comes in. 
    
    				NURSE
    			(to Robson)
    		Dr. Blake is out, but I left word.
    
    345	LUISE and the NURSE
    
    				LUISE
    			(to the nurse)
    		I do not think Mr. Conroy should be 
    		left alone.
    
    	The nurse looks at ...
    
    346	... ROBSON who, after a dark glance at Luise, nods 
    	his assent.
    
    347	LUISE exits.
    
    					CUT TO:
    
    348	THE LIVING ROOM
    	Brazil stands in the center of the living room, 
    	balancing himself on legs spread far apart. He holds 
    	his left arm tight to his side, straight down. He 
    	wears a dark overcoat buttoned high against his 
    	throat. His face is a ghastly yellow mask in which 
    	his eyes burn redly. He turns to see that he's being 
    	watched by ...
    
    349	LUISE 
    	She stands in the living room door, the stairs
    	in view behind her.
    
    350	BRAZIL, advancing unsteadily.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(hostile)
    		They told me you'd come back. I had 
    		to see it.
    
    351	LUISE crosses her arms.
    
    				LUISE
    		Do not be a fool. I -- 
    
    	She breaks off as the nurse passes the doorway. 
    
    				LUISE
    			(sharply)
    		Miss George, what are you doing?
    
    352	The NURSE turns to Luise, innocently.
    
    				NURSE
    		Mr. Robson said he thought I might 
    		be able to reach Dr. Blake on the 
    		phone at Mrs. Webber's.
    
    353	A dark look crosses LUISE's face. She turns, pauses 
    	to kick off her slippers, and runs up the steps on
    	stockinged feet. Halfway up, she looks down at ...
    
    354	... the NURSE and BRAZIL who stare up at her, confused.
    
    355	LUISE continues up, seeing ...
    
    356	... the door to Conroy's room is shut. 
    
    357	LUISE approaches and flings it open. She sees ...
    
    358	ROBSON leaning over CONROY. His hands are on Conroy's
    	bandaged head, holding it almost face down in the 
    	pillow.
    
    359	LUISE gasps.
    
    360	ROBSON's thumbs press the back of Conroy's skull. All 
    	his weight seems to be on his thumbs. His face is 
    	twisted, insane. His lips are wet. He looks up and 
    	sees ...
    
    361	... LUISE who turns and looks down the stairs at ...
    
    362	... BRAZIL and the NURSE who stand together at the 
    	bottom of the stairs, puzzled.
    
    363	LUISE screams:
    
    				LUISE
    		Brazil!
    
    364	THE SICKROOM
    	Luise flings herself at Robson and tries to pull him 
    	away. He savagely kicks her.
    
    365	LUISE falls to the floor but scrambles back, clawing 
    	at Robson's legs. He's forced to let go of Conroy's 
    	head. Luise turns her head and sees ...
    
    366	... BRAZIL who bursts into the room, lurching blindly, 
    	his left arm tight to his side. He swings his right 
    	fist and misses Robson's head by a foot.
    
    367	ROBSON strikes Brazil twice in the face, to no effect.
    
    368	The NURSE enters and tends to CONROY who tries to sit 
    	up in bed, tears streaming down his face.
    
    368	BRAZIL puts his right fist into Robson's belly. Luise's 
    	grip on Robson's ankles keep him from recovering his 
    	balance and he goes down heavily. Brazil goes down 
    	with him but, unlike Robson, stays conscious.
    
    369	BRAZIL and LUISE, both out of breath on the floor, 
    	look at each other over Robson's unconscious body.
    
    				LUISE
    		Thank you.
    
    				BRAZIL
    			(slight grin)
    		'S'okay. I enjoyed it.
    
    	Luise, unsmiling, looks up to see that ...
    
    370	... IN THE DOORWAY, Ito leads three PLAINCLOTHESMEN 
    	from the sheriff's office into the room. The tallest 
    	one looks at ...
    
    371	... the unconscious ROBSON. LUISE and BRAZIL look up 
    	at ...
    
    372	... the TALL MAN who chuckles.
    
    				TALL MAN
    		Well, well, well ... if it isn't Mr. 
    		Brazil.
    			(to the other men)
    		There's our lad that don't like 
    		hospitals. It's a good thing he 
    		didn't escape from a gymnasium or 
    		he might've hurt somebody.
    
    371	LUISE AND BRAZIL
    	Brazil tenses up. He knows he's caught. Luise looks 
    	on worriedly.
    
    372	2ND PLAINCLOTHESMEN, NURSE and CONROY
    	A 2nd Plainclothesman joins Conroy at bedside.
    
    				2ND PLAINCLOTHESMEN
    		Hello, Conroy. Glad you're awake. 
    		We could use a statement from you 
    		before we lock up Brazil for good. 
    		What did he do, come up here to 
    		finish you off?
    
    	Conroy looks confused.
    
    				CONROY
    			(weakly)
    		Brazil? It wasn't Brazil. It was 
    		Robson. 
    
    373	LUISE's eyes glitter.
    
    374	BRAZIL's eyes search the floor, puzzled.
    
    375	The 2ND PLAINCLOTHESMEN's eyes narrow.
    
    				2ND PLAINCLOTHESMEN
    		Brazil didn't hit ya and knock you 
    		into his fireplace?
    
    376	CONROY thinks for a second.
    
    				CONROY
    		Well, he did. But it was Robson ...
    		It was Robson who stumbled over a 
    		piece of wood while he was helping 
    		me back to the car ... and he hit 
    		me over the head with it. I was too
    		drunk to stop him. 
    			(to Luise) 
    		He said it was my fault you ran out 
    		on him. Something about parasites 
    		not mixing.
    
    377	LUISE stares in disbelief.
    
    378	2ND PLAINCLOTHESMAN AND CONROY
    
    				2ND PLAINCLOTHESMAN
    		Will you put that in a statement?
    
    				CONROY
    			(nods weakly)
    		Sure.
    
    	The 2nd Plainclothesman moves off.
    
    				2ND PLAINCLOTHESMAN
    		Son of a bitch.
    
    379	LUISE has BRAZIL sitting up on the floor with his 
    	back to a wall, wiping his face with her handkerchief. 
    	He opens one eye to Luise.
    
    				BRAZIL
    		The guy was screwy, wasn't he? 
    
    	She puts an arm around him and laughs with a cooing 
    	sound in her throat. 
    
    				LUISE
    		All men are.
    
    	She glances down at Robson as she pulls at her fingers,
    	taking off her rings. With a look of triumph, she 
    	places them ...
    
    380	... ON THE FLOOR beside Robson's left foot. We hold on 
    	this image for a moment before we ...
    
    					FADE OUT
