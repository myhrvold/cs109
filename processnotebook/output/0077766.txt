	FADE IN

1	UNDERWATER - SEA BOTTOM - DAY						1

	A pair of divers, one in a black suit and one wearing orange,
	search for lobster in the nooks and crannies of a rock forma-
	tion.  Black Suit carries a camera with strobe light.  Orange
	Suit has a canvas bag clipped to his belt.  He flushes out a
	large lobster and holds it up...an admiring "Hmm!" from Black
	Suit, who brings up his camera and focuses.  A funny pose
	with the lobster and -- flash! -- Black Suit takes the shot,
	and moves off to try another spot -- and gives another "Hmm!"
	-- there's a length of heavy rope, frayed and overgrown with
	algae.  It leads across the bottom.  They follow it through
	rocks...and suddenly the bottom is no longer there.  The rope
	cascades down, disappearing in the gloom beyond the lip of
	a cliff.  They check their depth gauges, surprised to find
	this sudden dropoff leading down to God knows where.  They
	follow the line down.  Seaweed hangs from a ruined metal
	barrel strung on the line.  They proceed further down ---


2	THE ORCA								2

	The line is leading them to a hulking shape...its outline
	clearer now...a sunken boat!  A battered, algae-covered
	wreck, lying on its side in the depth.  The gentle back-and-
	forth of the water sways a forest of eelgrass and creaks the
	cables of the rigging.  Excited hums and whinnies from the
	divers, and Black Suit rubs at the green muck on the prow,
	revealing the boat's name:  ORCA!  Animated nods and gestures
	-- they recognize it, and what a find, and salvage rights
	for the two of them!  Clowning elatedly, Orange Suit turns a
	somersault, then whips out his knife and begins to scratch
	their claim on the hull.

	Black Suit moves off alone to explore their prize.  The slant
	of the deck is disorienting.  He swims into the dark entrance
	to the cabin.  Scratching noises from the knife are amplified
	in the water.  Junk floats against the cabin ceiling.

	Orange Suit finishes writing "CLAIMED BY J. MONATO & M. LAUB."
	He looks around for his friend and doesn't see him.  Swimming
	over the wreck he looks into the broken windows of the cabin.
	Something's moving in the darkness.  He enters through the
	window.  The lid of a hatch swings soundlessly back and forth.
	Light from the cabin door barely penetrates the dark chamber.
	No sign of his buddy.  Silence except for his breathing and
	the soft steady creaking of metal rigging.  He fins toward
	the open door and suddenly, lurching in his face, is Black
	Suit, screaming wildly.  He's found a huge skillet, several
	bottles of soda, and some booze.

	Orange Suit grabs the liquor and indicates it's time to go
	back up.  As they rise slowly, he mimes (for his buddy's
	camera) drinking from the bottle -- and accidentally drops it.
	Groaning, he swims quickly down, snatching it before it lands.
	A flash goes off and he turns smiling up into the camera,
	and there he sees to his horror, his buddy in the jaws of a
	Great White, a cloud of blood half-obscuring them.  A moment
	of staring-eyed hesitation and then, knife poised, he fins
	toward the Shark...which tosses aside the dead man and now
	swiftly seizes on him...a thrashing, a glimpse of the knife
	dropping, and the end of him dimly seen through the darkening
	water.


	TITLES


3	EXT. AMITY ROAD - DAY							3

	Martin Brody's squad car speeds past the Amity billboard,
	weather-stained, peeling and flaking in the strong May sun-
	shine.  Over the wind we hear snatches of a speech-making
	voice on a P. A. system.


4	INT. SQUAD CAR - BRODY							4

	has the look of a survivor who will never shake off the memory
	of what he survived.  He passes:


5	BEACHSIDE COTTAGES							5

	closed and in disrepair.  A faded upside-down FOR RENT sign in
	one of the windows.  The o.s. voice continues --


6	BOARDINGHOUSE								6

	Its only sign of life an old woman, bundled up and sitting on
	a rocking chair near the steps, her face raised to the sun.
	 	The o.s. voice continues --


7	THE BEACH								7

	No people, just a few stray dogs chasing each other and rooting
	in the sand.  Dominating the beach is a 50-foot-high metal
	shark tower.  As the o.s. voice elicits a distant patter of
	applause, Brody arrives at:


8	EXT. SWIMMING POOL AND GROUNDS OF AMITY SHORES				8

	where a ceremony is taking place:  above the speech-maker
	-- Mayor Vaughan -- stretches a banner reading AMITY SHORES, INC.
	and applauding around the pool are the leading townsmen of
	Amity and their friends.

	Behind Mayor Vaughan is his wife, caught up in the prevailing
	mood, and their son, Reeves.

	The newly-built pool is on the grounds of a housing project in
	construction.  Beyond the buffet table is the high school band.

	Prominent at the poolside is Brody's family:  his wife Ellen,
	and his sons Mike (15) and Sean (7) fidgeting.  Brody slips
	through the crowd to join them.

				   VAUGHAN
		   And so, before we inaugurate this
		   lovely new swimming facility, I'd
		   like to say, on behalf of my fellow
		   Amity-ites....

				   BRODY
			   (simultaneously
			   whispering to Ellen)
		   Sorry I'm late.  I got a call from
		   the Coast Guard.

	Ellen slips her arm around him.

				   VAUGHAN
		   ...how grateful we are to Resort
		   Enterprises and their representa-
		   tive here, our new neighbor Len
		   Peterson ---

	Applause and whistles as the man beside him waves acknowledge-
	ment.  Leonard Peterson, about 50, is an impressive looking
	man with an air of good-humored irony.

				   VAUGHAN
		   -- not just for making this pool
		   available to us, I mean for every-
		   thing.  By casting an eye on our
		   little town and coming to develop
		   Amity Shores here, well, that's
		   going to give us a whole new lease
		   on life -- and after a few of the
		   toughest years this town's ever had,
		   we're not too proud I hope to admit it!

	Applause.  Next to Brody is a thirtyish gym teacher and skin-
	diving instructor, Tom Andrews.  The Mayor's speech continues
	in the b.g. as Andrews smiles at Brody and gestures at the
	pool ---

				   ANDREWS
			   (whispering)
		   Perfect, huh?

				   BRODY
		   Two divers from Dutch Harbor are
		   missing.

				   ANDREWS
		   Who?

				   BRODY
		   Don't know.  The Coast Guard found
		   their boat.  Beer, some uppers,
		   no divers.

				   ANDREWS
			   (already suspicious)
		   What was the name of their boat?

				   BRODY
		   The Sea something.

				   ANDREWS
		   The Sea Dart?
			   (Brody nods)
		   I knew those guys.  I dove with
		   them once.

	Andrews stares somberly into the water; Brody thinking, as:

				   VAUGHAN
			   (continues)
		   ...and Len estimates that within a
		   few months he'll have fifty condo-
		   minium units completed and occupied --
			   (plows on through
			   a smattering of
			   applause)
		   -- and twice that many again in
		   another few months!

	More applause.  Vaughan continues o.s. as:

				   BRODY
			   (emphatically)
		   So you're going to have the kids
		   skin-dive here in this pool.  Aren't
		   you, Tom?

				   ANDREWS
		   Not Mike and his group, they've
		   done their pool work.  He'll be
		   taking his open-water Junior soon.
		   Open-water -- you know, in the ocean.

				   BRODY
		   In the ocean.  Not Mike.

				   ANDREWS
			   (shakes his head,
			   laughing)
		   Come on Martin, we went through this
		   when you signed the form.

				   BRODY
		   In fact, I don't want him diving
		   at all.

	Brody's son is overhearing, taking it in stride.

				   ANDREWS
		   He's the best of my juniors, Mike!
		   First-rate diving material!

				   BRODY
		   Were your two friends from Dutch
		   Harbor first-rate diving material
		   too?

				   ANDREWS
		   They weren't my friends.  A couple
		   of spaced out machos.  Probably
		   stoned and weren't watching their
		   air.  Maybe got stuck in a cave or
		   a net...anything could've happened
		   with those guys!

				   BRODY
		   With both of them?

	Andrews shrugs:  yes, conceivably with both of them.  Brody
	concedes -- it's possible.

				   VAUGHAN
			   (continuing)
		   -- and next year, God willing,
		   another set of fine condominiums,
		   real homes for people with fire-
		   places, round-the-clock tennis
		   courts, an eighteen-hole golf course
		   and for some of you younger frisk-
		   ier marrieds like the Brodys over
		   there and maybe this'll get his
		   attention, yes I see it has -- we
		   even have plans for -- a jacuzzi!
			   (Brody joins in
			   the general
			   laughter.
			   Ellen pretends
			   to blush, covers
			   her face)
		   But seriously, folks, we're gonna
		   be back on our feet, we're gonna
		   be back on top as a secure family-
		   oriented resort community and that's
		   why we say
			   (over crescendo
			   of applause, Brody
			   clapping too)
		   Welcome, Amity Shores!  We say
		   Welcome, Amity Shores!

	A fanfare from the band cuts across the applause, and we see
	the town's five Selectmen, in bathrobes, lining up dutifully
	at the other end of the pool, Officer Hendricks beside them.

				   VAUGHAN
		   Ready?  Okay!
			   (as they take off
			   their robes and
			   stand shivering)
		   Here, to make this opening a hundred
		   percent official --
			   (over whistles
			   and laughter)
		   I give you the Amity Board of
		   Selectmen!

				   HENDRICKS
			   (raising his
			   pistol)
		   On your mark...get set....

	He fires, and they flop in.  As they do their laps, the band
	playing a gallop and their fellow townsmen cheering them on,
	we close in on Brody.  He's not entertained, he's just looking
	at the splashing arms and legs.


8-A	WATCHTOWER								8-A

	High above the beach, perched atop the fifty-foot shark tower,
	Brody watches the activity below.

	The season's first bathers carefully toe the water.  It's
	still too cold, except for a few hearty souls...like Harry,
	the old guy from the first picture wearing "one crazy hat,"
	who streaks past to plunge into the icy surf.

	Len Peterson, of Amity Shores, Inc., appears at the base of
	the tower.  His Mercedes waits near Brody's squad car with
	its door open -- someone sits in the front seat.

				   PETERSON
			   (calling up)
		   Chief!

				   BRODY
		   Yeah?  Oh, hiya Mr. Peterson.  You
		   want to see me?

				   PETERSON
		   Several potential buyers are coming
		   here on Sunday.  I'll be running
		   groups over every weekend.

				   BRODY
			   (starts to climb
			   down)
		   Fine, I'll make sure everything's
		   tidied up, no uncollected garbage
		   or anything.

				   PETERSON
		   I wonder if this could be taken
		   down?

				   BRODY
		   It's permanent.

				   PETERSON
		   What do you watch from it?  Been
		   nothing for two or three years.

				   BRODY
		   Nothing we've been able to see.

				   PETERSON
		   That's exactly what it makes people
		   feel.

				   BRODY
			   (arriving at
			   his side)
		   If it were up to me, Mr. Peterson,
		   I wouldn't only have a watchtower,
		   I'd have that water protected with
		   a ring of steel from the beach to
		   fifty yards out.
			   (they walk
			   toward the
			   car)
		   Wouldn't cost all that much either.
		   One-hundred-gauge steel mesh with
		   concrete blocks at the bottom.

				   PETERSON
		   Any time off for good behavior?

				   BRODY
		   I know how it sounds, but I know
		   this too...years ago the water
		   was full of fish, plenty for sharks
		   to eat.  Now, fewer fish and the
		   water's full of people.  Know what
		   I mean?

	They've reached the beach road.  Mayor Vaughan sits in
	Peterson's car.

				   BRODY
		   Hi Larry, didn't see you.

				   VAUGHAN
		   Staying in here where it's warm.
		   Are you still pushing that beach
		   plan??  You know we can't afford
		   it.

				   BRODY
		   I thought he might be interested.
			   (starting
			   for his
			   car)
		   Think it over, Mr. Peterson.

				   PETERSON
		   Kind of intense about it, isn't
		   he?

				   VAUGHAN
		   Don't mind the Chief.  He gets
		   like that every year at this time.
		   You can understand why.
			   (pause)
		   He's a good man though, Len.

				   PETERSON
		   You don't seem so sure of it.

8-A-1	EXT. AMITY - DAY - BRODY PATROLS HIS TOWN				8-A-1

	He views with mixed feelings signs that spring is further
	advanced.  Trees are blooming, boats are being launched --
	among them we notice one with a fresh coat of yellow paint
	being lowered into the water by Heller.  Slipping out of his
	coat, he greets Brody.

				   HELLER
		   Hey, Martin, how you doing?  Feel
		   that sun...be summer before you
		   know it...ain't you warm in that
		   thing?

				   BRODY
		   No.  I like to pretend it's still
		   winter.

							CUT TO


9	AMITY STREET - DAY							9

	Two teenage bicyclists in "Andover" windbreakers, one of
	them Reeves Vaughan the Mayor's son, are trying to give
	Brody an argument as he writes them a citation.

				   REEVES
		   We didn't hit anyone.

				   BRODY
		   Yet.

				   REEVES
		   Be a sport, Chief!  My dad'll
		   kill me!

				   BRODY
		   I warned you last weekend, Reeves
		   -- no riding on the sidewalk.
			   (hands him the
			   citation)
		   My regards to the Mayor.


10	EXT. FERRY SLIP - NIGHT							10

	Stillness, except for the base thudding of the ferry's
	engine as it noses in and bumps into place.  The doors open
	and footsteps clang down the gangway.  Brody watches the
	first few tourists of the season stream through pools of
	light.  Summer -- it's beginning.

							DISSOLVE TO


11	DOCK - DAY - THE YELLOW BOAT						11

	is filling with a party of four, beer, water-skis, and extra
	five gallon can of gas, fishpoles, lunch.  Heller, his wife
	Dee and another couple have brought enough stuff for a trans-
	Atlantic crossing in their little boat.

				   HELLER
			   (donning a
			   nautical cap)
		   Stand by to cast off.

				   DEE
		   Avast ye swabs!  Port to Starboard!
		   Yo Ho Heave Ho!  Straight as she
		   goes ---

				   HELLER
			   (breaking out
			   the beer)
		   -- and a bottle of rum before and
		   aft....

	This nonsense fades as they chug away from the dock.

							CUT TO


12	SEA OFF AMITY - PETERSON'S CABIN CRUISER				12

	Heading toward the town...Peterson in a yachting cap, at the
	controls, spieling to the new group of prospective buyers --
	two late-middle-age couples, a thirtyish couple with a Little
	Girl, and an Elderly Man with an expensive-looking camera.

				   PETERSON
		   Over there's the harbor, been in
		   use two hundred years, nearly...
		   Quite a few sort of antique houses,
		   too ---

	At the cry of a pelican the Elderly Man looks up and aims his
	camera.


13	ELDERLY MAN								13

	as he eagerly lines up his shot ---

				   PETERSON (o.s.)
		   How's it feel to breathe real air,
		   huh?

	A chorus of appreciative "mm's."


14	THE PELICAN								14

	seen through his viewfinder:  it wheels and dives full tilt
	straight down, smashing the water with a crazy suicidal splash
	-- the shutter clicks.  The pelican emerges with a fish.

	As we follow its circling ascent:

				   PETERSON (o.s.)
		   Honey, you want to steer the boat
		   awhile?

	The pelican dives again...the shutter clicks.

				   LITTLE GIRL (o.s.)
		   I don't like boats.

	Laughter...the bird comes up with another fish.  Another click.
	We following its wheeling again.

				   PETERSON (o.s.)
		   She'll learn to like 'em in Amity!
		   Little guys her age practically
		   live in the water here ---

	The pelican dives -- click!

				   PETERSON (o.s.)
		   Plenty to do and see for everybody,
		   all ages.  Well, you know our con-	
		   cept, let the place speak for
		   itself.

	Pause...the pelican has not come up...the Little Girl begins
	humming...it still doesn't come up.


15	ELDERLY MAN AND THE OTHERS						15

	He's lowering his camera, looking out to sea, very puzzled,
	as Peterson's boat passes the yellow boat in the mouth of
	the harbor.


16	YELLOW BOAT - HELLER'S PARTY						16

	As they clear the harbor mouth the other couple drops off the
	back of the boat with their black Fiberglas water-skis.

				   WOMAN
		   Okay, wait, wait, don't start yet.

				   HELLER
		   Say when.

				   DEE
		   Isn't it too crowded here?

				   HELLER
		   Yeah, I'll go over that way.

				   WOMAN
		   Watch me now, watch how I get up.

	A false start -- she's not very good -- and she's up.


17	ANGLE									17

	They head out to a deserted stretch of water.


18	THE WATER SKIERS							18

				   WOMAN
		   Look, watch this!

	Whooping and carrying on, she does a spastic, one-legged
	ballerina.

				   MAN
		   Oh, Boy!  That's really -- terrible.


19	UNDERWATER - FROM SHARK'S POINT OF VIEW					19

	Two pairs of black water-skis leave a frothy trail.


20	A FIN									20

	appears in the water behind the skiers.


21	BOAT - DEE								21

	is the first to spot it.

				   DEE
			   (stiffens)
		   Jesus Christ!


22	ANGLE									22

				   HELLER
		   Shark.  A shark!

				   DEE
		   Oh God, do something.

				   HELLER
		   Get them the hell away from it.

	He twists the throttle and the little boat jerks forward
	almost pulling the skiers off balance.

				   MAN
		   Hey!  What the hell?

	Then he too sees the fin.

	At first, they try to outrun it.

				   WOMAN
		   I can't!  I'll fall!!  Please!
		   Please somebody help me.


23	BOAT - HELLER								23

	is forced to slow down.

				   DEE
		   Can't we get them aboard?


24	THE SKIERS								24

	sink a little in the water as the boat slows.

				   MAN
		   No!  We can't stop!!

	Heller speeds up.  For an eternity the Shark seems content
	just to follow what is being so appetizingly trolled.  They
	attempt a wide turn to head back toward land...the skiers
	screaming.


25	BEACH HOUSE DECK - AN OLD LADY						25

	glances up from her book.  From where she sits they seem to
	be having a wonderful time.


26	THE SKIERS								26

	try to work their way hand-over-hand to the boat but as they
	approach safety the wake is too much for the woman and she
	loses her balance.  The Shark strikes her as she falls.  She
	is dragged for a few seconds through the water by the rope,
	then grabbed by her husband.  She clings to him screaming in
	terror as the Shark hits her again.  And again.


27	DEE AND HELLER								27

	are crying and flinging clothes, picnic basket, and oar,
	everything they can lay their hands on at the Shark.  He
	shouts at her to open the extra can of gasoline and pour some
	on a rag.

	The man is doing his best to hang on to his wife, but he's
	losing her.  He brutally takes a turn of her hair around
	his hand.  The Shark, seemingly confident that its victims
	won't escape, is taking its time.  It swims leisurely in
	for more.

				   WOMAN
		   BILLY!  BILLY!

	She hugs his legs, begging him for help.  The Shark brushes
	her with its head and drops back a few yards.

	On the boat, Dee hysterically slops gas down her legs and on
	the deck.  Heller crams the soaked rag into the mouth of the
	can.

	In the water, the woman's no longer screaming.  Billy looks
	down at her.  Her face is a pallid mask.  She's no longer
	aware who her husband is.  She's dying.  Billy can't stand
	it, it's too much for him and he loses his balance.

	The Shark thrusts its powerful tail, coming in for the kill
	as Billy cartwheels awkwardly into the water, twisting,
	hugging, snarling in the tow-line in his pathetic determina-
	tion to hold on to what is no longer the woman.  The line
	snaps taut pulling his shoulder from its socket, raising a
	wide cloud of pink spray as they're dragged through the water
	sideways.  No longer content with slashing bites, the Shark's
	jaws close on the woman and won't let go, its head vibrating
	from side to side.  Billy is strangling in the line ---

	Heller lights the soaked rag and heaves the five gallon can
	at the Shark.

	A tremendous explosion of shrapnel, a ball of flame, and the
	enraged Shark crashes onto the stern of the boat with one side
	of its head aflame...sending Dee, the gas-soaked deck, and the
	boat's own tank up in blinding succession leaving nothing but a
	smoldering, sinking mess to plunge to the bottom.

28	DUSK - THE AMITY P.D. BOAT						28

	is fishing up a few pieces of what remains.  A tangle of
	towline leads across the deck to a body covered with a sheet
	of black vinyl.

				   HENDRICKS
			   (on 2-way)
		   Yeah, just the one guy who got
		   strangled in the line.  Nothing
		   much else to do here, Chief.  A
		   few cushions, some miscellaneous.
		   We'll have to drag tomorrow for
		   the others.


29	BEACH HOUSE - DECK - BRODY AND OLD LADY					29

				   BRODY
			   (on 2-way)
		   Better get started tonight.

				   HENDRICKS (o.s.)
		   But Chief -- this swell's coming
		   up.  And the current's moved every-
		   thing anyway ---

				   BRODY
		   Tonight.

				   HENDRICKS (o.s)
			   (groans)
		   Roger.

	Brody turns back to the Old Lady.

				   BRODY
		   So, that's all you saw?

				   OLD LADY
		   That's all.  One minute they were
		   havin' a heck of a time and the
		   next I know the whole thing just
		   blew to smithereens.  Who were
		   they?  Off-islanders?

				   BRODY
		   No, friends.

							CUT TO


30	EXT. BRODY HOUSE - EVENING						30

	Glad to be home, Brody turns into his driveway.  There is a
	light from the garage.  His sons Mike and Sean and Mike's
	chubby friend, Andy, are scrubbing a catamaran sailboat.
	Mike Brody is fifteen, very good-looking and knows it.

				   BRODY
			   (slowly getting
			   out of his car)
		   What the hell is that?

				   MIKE
		   Doug let me have it cheap.  A
		   beaut isn't it?  What's the
		   matter?

				   BRODY
		   Nothing.

				   SEAN
			   (7 years old)
		   That old boat was too small.  Mike
		   said we couldn't race with that.
		   I'm going with them.

				   MIKE
		   No you aren't.

				   ANDY
			   (wears heavy braces)
		   The guys run out to the lighthouse
		   and back now, Mr. Brody.  He needs
		   this.  It's much safer.

				   MIKE
		   This will be a racer, and the old
		   boat leaks and I'm paying for this
		   myself.

				   SEAN
		   I like it.  Don't you like it, Dad?

				   BRODY
			   (turning to go in)
		   I don't want to talk about it now.
		   I guess at least it's better than
		   diving.

				   MIKE
		   You know I wish you'd believe Tom
		   Andrews.  Diving is safer than
		   camping out or driving a car ---

				   BRODY
		   Or parachute jumping.

31	INT. KITCHEN DINING AREA						31

	Ellen turns the stove on to heat up his dinner.

				   BRODY
			   (pouring a drink)
		   I'm not too hungry.

				   ELLEN
		   Yeah, I heard.  How did it happen?

				   BRODY
		   I wish I knew.

	The three Kids stream through the kitchen on their way to
	get something from Mike's room.  Sean hangs back and leans
	up against his father.

				   SEAN
		   Guess what, Dad?

				   BRODY
		   What?

				   SEAN
		   Andy's moving away.  And his
		   mother too.

				   BRODY
		   No kidding.

				   ELLEN
		   How come you're moving, Andy?

	He tromps back in and rummages through the refrigerator.

				   ANDY
		   My mother got laid off again.  Not
		   enough work in the restaurant.

				   ELLEN
		   That's too bad.  Mike'll miss you.

				   SEAN
		   Me too.

				   MIKE
			   (entering)
		   Miss him?  Barf!

				   ELLEN
		   Can't she find another job?

				   BRODY
		   In this town?

			 	   ANDY
		   She's got a job on the mainland,
		   I think, in the fall.

				   ELLEN
		   Maybe she could get a job here
		   with the Amity Shores project
		   before then.  Martin says some
		   people are getting work already,
		   and if they really get rolling....

				   ANDY
		   ...anyway, until this is all re-
		   solved, you won't mind if I sort
		   of move into your refrigerator.

				   ELLEN
		   I thought you had.

	Andy smiles, peanut butter sticking to his braces.

				   MIKE
		   He's selling his braces.  Wanta
		   buy them.

				   ELLEN
		   No thanks.

				   ANDY
		   Your loss.

	The Kids go back outside, Andy dripping peanut butter and
	jelly across the kitchen floor.

				   ANDY
			   (going out the door)
		   Things'll never be the same without
		   me, huh?

	Brody sits in silence for a moment -- smiling, but involved
	in his own thoughts.

32	UNDERWATER - NIGHT - A LARGE METAL RAKE					32

	scrapes along the ocean floor leaving clouds of silt in its
	wake.  It rises toward the surface.

	The P.D. Boat's searchlight scans the waves:  the wind has
	risen sharply, whipping their crests to foam.  Winching the
	rake to the stern, Hendricks frees it of seaweed and drops
	it back in.

33	INT. BRODY BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT				33

	Brody is awake.  There's something he can't get out of his
	mind.  He gets out of bed, pulls on his pants.


34	ON HIS DESK								34

	is a photograph.  He's smiling, shaking hands with Matt Hooper.
	And a plaque:  "Martin Brody, Amity Man of the Year, 1975."
	Beyond the desk is the sea.  A storm is coming.  He unlocks
	a drawer and takes out:  a box of .38 caliber hollow-point
	bullets, a twenty-five cc vial of sodium cyanide, and a dispos-
	able plastic syringe.  From a cupboard in the dining room he
	gets a red candle.  He turns the desk lamp on, opens the box
	of bullets.  Carefully, one by one, he stands them on end.

35	AT SEA - MIDDLE OF NIGHT - THE P.D. BOAT				35

	is still dragging.

				   HENDRICKS
		   Okay, pull her up.

	They put the boat in neutral and start the winch.  A few yards
	of line come up, then the winch grinds slowly to a stop with
	the weight of something very heavy.

				   HENDRICKS
			   (working its gears)
		   Damn, this thing never works right.

	Now the line begins to rise again, slowly tipping the boat,
	bringing its stern almost level with the waves from the weight
	of its burden.

				   HENDRICKS
		   Jesus, something really heavy.

	What could be so heavy...a piece of the burned boat...a body?

	It's coming up.  The searchlight finds it.  They bring it
	closer.  Great tendrils of kelp hang from the rake, obscuring
	what's underneath.  Afraid of what he'll find, Hendricks
	carefully removes slippery weeds and discovers, draped across
	the rake's claws, a six-inch-thick insulated cable.

				   HENDRICKS
		   For Christ's sakes, it's the
		   electric line from the mainland!
			   (he frees it and
			   drops it back in)
		   I told him we'd never find anything
		   in this weather.

				   ANOTHER OFFICER
		   One more time?

	The P.D. Boat's lights cast eerie forms on the waves and it's
	cold -- Hendricks doesn't like it at all.

				   HENDRICKS
		   Let's get the hell out of here
		   before we do find something.

36	BRODY'S DESK - LETHAL BLUE LIQUID					36

	is drawn from the vial into the syringe.  Brody inserts the
	needle into the hollow point of a bullet and fills it.  He
	tips the candle, sealing the poison in with a drop of wax.
	A hand touches him.

				   ELLEN
		   For God's sake, Martin!  What is
		   the matter?  Why are you doing
		   that?

				   BRODY
		   Why do you think?

				   ELLEN
		   What I think doesn't matter.  It's
		   what you think.

				   BRODY
		   I want to ask you a question.  Four
		   people are...

				   ELLEN
		   We've been through this already.

				   BRODY
			   (carefully placing
			   the prepared bullets
			    back in the box)
		   Four people are out in a boat.  It
		   blows up with two of them in it.
		   Okay.  The other two are water-
		   skiing behind it.  What happens to
		   them?  Could they blow up?  One of
		   them is strangled in the tow-line.
		   The other can't be found.  What
		   happened to that one?

				   ELLEN
		   I don't know.

				   BRODY
			   (locks box in drawer)
		   I'm asking you, doesn't that seem
		   strange to you?

				   ELLEN
		   Yes it does, but the whole inci-
		   dent is weird...Martin, come back
		   to bed,
			   (going)
		   you're exhausted.

				   BRODY

	He doesn't follow her.

37	EXT. PORCH - NIGHT							37

38	BEACH - NIGHT - SNOW FENCE						38

	Billowing clouds and a steady surf breaking, high tide is

	the deserted flotsam-littered shore, darkly communing with
	himself, plods Brody.


39	POINT OF VIEW FROM THE WATER						39

	Something unseen keeps slow pace with him.


40	BEACH - BRODY								40

	stops, and looks out to sea, the source of his haunting
	fears and nightmarish memories.  After a moment he walks
	on, then stops and turns.  He's seen something in the surf,
	he's curious...peering, he walks out onto the wet sand.  We
	see it now, near the buoy, a large piece of something bright
	yellow.  From the boat?  Brody can't tell, steps out farther,
	water's flowing over his shoes, he hardly notices.

	The waves aren't bringing it in, he looks around for a stick,
	a pole...nothing...he'll have to wade out for it.  Three steps
	and he's up to his knees.  He backs away as a wave breaks,
	then goes forward again, keeping his eye on the yellow object.
	Slower now, almost parallel with it...another wave is coming...
	and suddenly a black shape lunges upon him from a wave.  He
	cries out, striking blindly at it ---


41	A BODY									41

	burned beyond recognition.


42	BRODY									42

	stands there panting...then, appalled by what he must do, he
	forces himself to approach the thing rolling in the sea.


43	UNDERWATER								43

	Brody's legs moving toward the body.


44	BRODY									44

				   CORONER
		   Wind's dying down.

				   BRODY
		   Well?

			   (dictating to Polly)
		   Minor lacerations, complete charring

				   BRODY
		   Lacerations??

				   CORONER
		   Not from what you think.

	He places a plastic bag containing several small pieces of
	jagged metal on the desk in front of Brody.

		   Well, what's the decision?

				   CORONER
		   If you're suspicious Martin, close

49	DOCK - MIKE BRODY'S CATAMARAN						49

	A considerable amount of work has been done on the new sailboat.
	Sean Brody sits on the dock throwing pieces of a hotdog to a
	school of small fish.  He watches his older brother Mike hang
	over the water to screw in supports for a fire extinguisher.  A
	cassette player is mounted on the mast.  Andy selects a tape.
	Music.

				   SEAN
		   Gee, that'll be neat when we're
		   out on the water.

				   ANDY
		   What do you mean "we?"

				   SEAN
		   I can come with you, can't I Mike?

				   MIKE
		   Sometimes, but let's get this
		   straight, Nudge, fundamentally
		   this boat is for one thing and
		   one thing only.

				   SEAN
		   Yeah...what?

				   MIKE
		   Making out.

				   SEAN
			   (oily)
		   Oh....

				   ANDY
		   See these cushions?  You know what

		   They're lifesavers


	Mike and Andy crack up.

		   Don't look now, but...mammaries....

				   ANDY
			   (whirling around)
		   Where?

				   MIKE
		   I said don't look!

	They busy themselves about the boat.  Mike eases the volume
	up on the music, and lounges on the bow casually dangling
	one hand in the water, very smooth.  Andy adjusts his velvet
	hat to a more attractive angle.

				   MIKE
		   God damn this zit!  Can you see
		   it from where you are?

				   ANDY
			   (grinning slowly,
			   wickedly)
		   Can you see my braces?


50	ANGELA AND BROOKE							50

	are walking in their direction.  They are indeed very well
	endowed -- although in different directions:  Angela on top,

51	OUT AT SEA - OFF THE LIGHTHOUSE						51

	About 20 small sailboats of every sort (dinghies, catamarans,
	Sunfishes, inflatables) are cruising around, most of them
	manned by young people in their teens and early twenties.
	Doug, a 17-year-old on his own in a tiny inflatable, knows
	what he's doing as he neatly comes about.  A scream from
	behind him.  All heads turn ---


52	MIKE BRODY'S CATAMARAN							52

	is nearly keeling over with a sudden gust, one pontoon high
	off the water, the other running below the surface.  Even
	part of the canvas framework stretched between the two pontoons
	is awash.  The scream was from Brooke, who's terrified at
	how far they're keeled over.  Mike eases off a little, and
	the boat levels.

				   BROOKE

		   Hey buddy why don't you head for
		   ol' lighthouse.  We can go
		   ashore, walk around, find shells,

	Mike nods as if the suggestion is a merely practical one
	and heads away from the other boats toward the lighthouse.

		   Your little brother's so cute.

53	THE ROCKS BENEATH THE LIGHTHOUSE					53

	are steep.  Waves break against them with hollow thuds.
	A small sailboat rides at anchor...Ed is 17, Tina is pretty
	and all his.  They are making their way down from the con-
	cealment of the rocks to swim back to their boat.

	From their point of view:  a black, floating shape on the
	water.

				   BROOKE

			   the shape)
		   Let's go see.

	Ed and Tina have seen it too, and are on their way to
	investigate.  Mike's boat cuts through the chop.


54	ANGLE - THE SHAPE							54

	ahead of them, closer, more defined now...a whale.


55	MIKE'S BOAT								55

	They're peering ahead.  Then:

				   ANDY
		   It's a whale, a dead whale!

				   MIKE
			   (cautious)
		   How do you know it's dead?

				   ANDY
		   Look!

	We're close enough now to see that it's listing slightly --
	and that its flank is pocked with large red holes.

	Ed and Tina arrive at the carcass.  It reeks, but they're
	fascinated.

				   ED
			   (awed)
		   Something's sure been chewing on him.

	From their point of view, the whale's flank:  now we can see
	clearly how great hunks of flesh have been torn from it.

56	OUT AT SEA - DUSK - WHALE						56

	The Amity P.D. Boat idles alongside the floating carcass,
	deputies manning the boat.  We see it is well equipped --
	first aid gear, emergency flares, and inflatable "Res-Q-Raft"
	in a suitcase-sized pack.  Brody leans over the side with
	his camera, taking a close shot of one of the bites.  His
	shark paranoia is rising -- and the smell of the decomposi-
	tion is making him ill.

				   BRODY
		   Now I want to measure a couple.

	He climbs over and takes a steel tape measure from his
	pocket, pulls out a couple feet of tape.

				   BRODY
		   Jesus, look at its teeth.  What

	Brody looks at a bite, and pulls out a bit more tape.  He

57	WOODS HOLE LABORATORY - MORNING						57

	Humming, buzzing, clicking, flashing electronic gear.

	peer into microscopes, monitoring instruments.  Not dis-
	tracted by the array, Brody's only concern is what Dr. Elkins
	(the Institute's director) has to say about his photographs
	and measurements.

				   DR. ELKINS
			   (looks at them
			   and nods)
		   Yes.  I would say this was the
		   work of a Great White.

	Relieved to have it out in the open, terrified of what it
	means, Brody is far away in another time.

				   BRODY
		   I knew it.

				   DR. ELKINS
		   There's no cause for alarm, though ---

				   BRODY
		   It was only ten miles out, Doctor
		   Elkins.  Listen...do sharks ever
		   return to the same location?

				   DR. ELKINS
		   Let me show you something ---


58	SHARK RESEARCH OFFICE							58

	Charts depicting types of sharks, glass cages containing
	rows of labeled teeth, a blowup of an aerial shot of
	thousands of migrating sharks, and a large map of the world,
	the oceans marked with many little symbols.

				   DR. ELKINS
		   This is what we know of the world's
		   shark population.  Whites often
		   travel through these waters --
			   (points from the
			   Carolinas to Maine)
		   -- quite a way out where it's deep
		   as a rule, between late spring and
		   early summer.

				   BRODY
		   Like around now.

				   DR. ELKINS
		   Yes...Probably they're following
		   whales, they like mammals.

				   BRODY
		   Yeah.

				   DR. ELKINS
		   That's when the whales are up here,
		   migrating north.  Baby sperm whales,
		   pilot whales, they're favorite
		   targets of the Whites.  This one
		   though, is a bit unusual.  This is
		   a killer whale, did you know that?
		   Yes, it took a particularly
		   powerful Great White to kill him.
		   Still...so far out it really implies
		   no danger to your beaches again.

				   BRODY
		   Attacks by sharks -- are they pretty
		   much random, or do they happen in
		   the same places?

				   DR. ELKINS
		   Yes, where there are a lot of sharks,
		   like Australia, or South Africa.
		   There's no other pattern as far as
		   we know.  And it's not a common
		   occurrence anyway.  More than five
		   times as many people are struck by
		   lightning.

				   BRODY
		   And lightning never strikes twice
		   in the same place?

				   DR. ELKINS
			   (leading him
			   from the room)
		   Not often.  I have something you
		   might be interested in ---


59	SHARK LAB - "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"					59

	Several testing systems in operation.  Two assistants are
	dissecting a brown shark.  Brody looks around uncomfortably.

				   DR. ELKINS
			   (gesturing
			   toward the
			   dissecting table)
		   Sharks produce an anti-body that
		   protects them from cancer.  Did
		   you know that?
			   (Brody shakes
			   his head)
		   Yes...if we can find out what that
		   anti-body is, sharks may prove to
		   be of great value to man.  Might
		   even save human lives ---

				   BRODY
		   That would be a switch.

				  DR. ELKINS
			   (watching Brody)
		   -- yet people are terrified of
		   sharks.  So terrified that they
		   hunt them down, mutilate them --
		   club them to death.  Sharks,
		   Mr. Brody, are God's creatures too.
			   (moves to a
			   glass tank)
		   We're just beginning to learn about
		   them, so much is still a mystery.

				   ASSISTANT
			   (at a tank)
		   Like a run on Elvis, Doctor?

				   DR. ELKINS
			   (nods, then
			   to Brody)
		   Visual stimuli.  Here, stand up
		   close to it...
			   (Brody hesitates)
		   ...there's no need to be afraid.

	As Brody looks at the shark's head behind the Plexiglas,
	the Assistant draws a blackout curtain around them...Brody
	and Dr. Elkins watch as he then proceeds, with a complex
	flashlight, to beam rays of different colors and intensities
	directly at the shark's eyes...lighting up the whole head
	with an eerie changing glow.

				   DR. ELKINS
		   Color and intensity...watch the
		   response....

	Close on the shark's eyes as the nictitating membrane and
	pupils move with the changes of light.

				   BRODY
		   My God, does that excite them too?
		   I thought it was just blood or
		   splashing ---

				   DR. ELKINS
			   (drawing back
			   the curtain)
		   Any number of things.  Sounds of
		   all sorts.  Sound is top of the
		   list, in fact.
			   (stepping to the
			   shark on the
			   dissecting table)
		   They have extraordinary hearing
		   apparatus, a kind of radar --
			   (pointing it out)
		   -- sensors running from head to
		   tail -- they pick up certain
		   frequencies and home in, like a
		   guided missile.

				   BRODY
		   What kind of frequencies?

				   DR. ELKINS
			   (moving to the
			   large tub)
		   Oh, quite a range.  And over con-
		   sidebar distances.  Irregular
		   sounds, unusual sounds, electrical
		   impulses, almost any low-frequency
		   vibrations --
			   (to another
			   Assistant)
		   Tape please, Bob?
			   (to Brody, pointing
			   to a spot in the wall
			   of the tub)
		   There's a little speaker in there.
		   Watch.

	The Assistant starts a tape machine, and Brody looks down
	into the tub, following the movements of the lemon shark
	with rigid fascination.

				   DR. ELKINS
		   Now he's just hearing peaceful
		   marine life...nothing special...
		   but now he hears the sound of a
		   wounded grouper a mile away --
			   (the shark noses
			   at the speaker,
			   agitated)
		   Now just silence --
			   (the shark resumes
			   circling as before)
		   Now -- watch him -- a Waring Blender,
		   low speed, same distance ---

	The shark pauses, then strikes at the speaker repeatedly,
	jaws wide and snapping.  Brody watches, appalled.

				   BRODY
		   Let me ask you -- this might seem
		   kind of stupid --

				   DR. ELKINS
		   What's that?

				   BRODY
		   They must get signals from each
		   other too ---

	Dr. Elkins shrugs.

				   BRODY
		   See, I've read how dolphins send
		   out whole messages -- I just won-
		   dered if a shark --
			   (pauses, embarrassed)
		   I mean, that one I killed...how do
		   we know it didn't communicate with
		   other sharks before it died.  May-
		   be it had a mate or something.
		   Maybe I left a trace in the water,
		   a smell -- or maybe they just sense
		   me in some way you don't know about
		   yet.  They never go for revenge or
		   anything like that, do they?

				   DR. ELKINS
			   (slightly amused)
		   Sharks, Mr. Brody, never take any-
		   thing personally.

	Brody nods, then looks back into the tub:  the lemon shark is
	circling again.

60	AMITY BEACH - DAY							60

	Brody on a dune above the beach, sweating, peering through
	field glasses.


61	BEACH FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW						61

	The cabanas, their paint weathered, are being scrubbed up for
	the season.  About 100 people on the beach, a dozen in the
	water.  Although it's the first swimmable weekend of the
	season, it's still a bit early in the day, and the water's
	cold.

	Reeves Vaughan and a boy with heavy sideburns arrive on their
	expensive ten-speeds and a sprawl in the sun.

	The Amity P.D. Boat is patrolling off shore.  The watchtower:
	a guard on duty at the top, a warning bell hangs beside him.
	As Brody scans out to sea again:

				   SEAN (o.s.)
		   Mom said eat your lunch.

	The boy has hiked up the dune -- he holds out a sandwich and
	thermos to his father.  Ellen has spread a blanket out on the
	sand.

				   BRODY
		   You eat it, Sean.

				   SEAN
		   I just had lunch.

				   BRODY
		   Good, then you can't go in the
		   water.

	Sean looks at him, wishing he hadn't said that.  We hear the
	sound of a large vehicle braking ---


62	A BRIGHTLY PAINTED BUS							62

	with AMITY SHORES lettered on its side pulls up close to the
	beach.  Peterson and Mayor Vaughan disembark, all smiles,
	followed by several affluent-looking couples carrying picnic
	lunches.

	Brody watches for a moment and looks seaward again.

	Two more people emerge from the Amity Shores bus:  a tired-
	looking mother and a girl of nine (Bunny) dragging her terrible
	dog behind her.  They look around as Peterson continues his
	soft sell.

				   PETERSON
		   ...Never very crowded or noisy,
		   almost a private beach really, one
		   of the finest on this coast.  Any-
		   one low on Bain de Soleil?
			   (they chuckle
			   appreciatively)
		   Enjoy yourselves.

	The people disperse to the sands.

				   ELLEN
		   Hi Larry!  Mr. Peterson!  Want some
		   lunch?

				   PETERSON
			   (sitting)
		   That's the best offer I've had
		   all...

	He breaks off:  the mother and her little girl are coming over,
	the child still dragging the dog.

				   MRS. RYAN
		   Oh, Mr. Peterson, I wanted to ask...
		   Bunny, stop that, leave that thing
		   alone!

				   PETERSON
		   Yes, Mrs. Ryan?

				   MRS. RYAN
		   I know I'm being silly, but is it
		   really safe to go in?

				   PETERSON
		   Absolutely.

				   VAUGHAN
		   Couldn't be safer!
			   (gestures at the
			   tower and P.D. Boat)
		   All these precautions!

				   MRS. RYAN
		   Yes, I noticed the policeman there.

	They follow her glance:  there's Brody, conspicuously poised
	at his vigil.

				   ELLEN
		   Oh, he's...bird watching, you know
		   ...seagulls, ducks....

				   BUNNY
		   No, he's not.

				   PETERSON
		   You and your little girl have your
		   dip, Mrs. Ryan.

	Nodding a bit doubtfully, she walks away.

				   PETERSON
		   There goes that sale.

				   ELLEN
		   He's doing his job.

				   PETERSON
		   Well, maybe we should ask him to
		   hold off doing his job until these
		   people leave.


63	BRODY									63

	is peering out at the bathers.

	His point of view:  Mrs. Ryan and Bunny wade into the water,
	Bunny carrying her reluctant dog out for a swimming lesson.

				   VAUGHAN (o.s.)
		   Martin, for Pete's sake.

	Brody lowers his binoculars, and sees Vaughan wallowing up the
	dune toward him.

				   VAUGHAN
		   Please quit standing up here with
		   those glasses.  There's no reason
		   for it, Martin, you'll scare people
		   to death.

	Brody doesn't reply, and continues his watch.  Vaughan
	crouches down beside him not wanting to be seen.

				   VAUGHAN
		   Will you stop acting crazy?  A
		   whale, a whale got killed fifteen
		   miles out....

				   BRODY
			   (scanning the beach)
		   Ten.

	Bunny is waist-deep trying to get her dog to swim.  It clings
	to her in terror.  She throws it into deeper water and her
	mother screams at her.  Bunny sticks her tongue out.

	Brody raises his binoculars beyond Bunny and goes rigid as he
	sees a large shadow undulating in the water.

				   BRODY
		   There.  What's that?

	Whatever it is, is moving in like a giant amoeba.  Gulls hover
	as it glides along beneath the surface, then dart and plunge,
	screaming as it moves closer.

	Brody drops his glasses.  Horrified, waving at the watchtower,
	he starts to run toward the beach.

				   VAUGHAN
			   (following)
		   Martin! ---


64	BRODY									64

	running -- down the dune to the beach, gesturing frantically --
	why doesn't the guard ring the bell?!!


65	TOWER PLATFORM - SAM THE GUARD						65

	is looking through field glasses, checking via walkie-talkie
	with the police boat.

				   SAM
		   What the hell is it?


66	OFF-SHORE - P.D. BOAT							66

				   OFFICER
			   (into walkie-talkie)
		   Don't know.  Too big to be a shark.


67	BRODY RUNNING HARDER							67

	He pulls out his gun as he runs and loads the prepared bullets.
	He trips on the edge of a blanket and staggers on, flying
	sand catching a child in the face.

	Still running, his eyes strain into glaring reflections on the
	water...it's difficult to determine what the shadow is.

	The child is crying.  People back off in alarm at the sight
	of him running, gun drawn.  Bunny's mother screams at her to
	get out of the water.  The obscure shape slides closer, rolling
	in toward shore.

				   BRODY
			   (screaming up
			   at the tower)
		   RING THE BELL!!

	Some bathers have seen the thing in the water and race out.
	Others point in wonder at the dark mass as little fish spring
	up from it.

	Attracted by all the excitement, Sean Brody has come down to
	the water's edge to investigate.

	Bunny has succeeded too well.  Her dog swims happily -- away
	from her.  She refuses to leave the water without him.

				   BUNNY
			   (crying, following
			   into deeper water)
		   Snapper, please come in!  Snapper!!

	She grabs him.  Her mother screams at her.


68	BRODY									68

	reaches the tower and starts to climb.

				   SAM
			   (leaning over)
		   It's okay, Chief!

				   BRODY
		   What are you talking about....

	He climbs the tower.  Vaughan, panting heavily, lumbers up
	below.

				   VAUGHAN
		   Martin...please!

				   BRODY
			   (on top)
		   Ring the bell!  Ring it!!

				   SAM
		   It's okay, Chief, look!  It's a
		   school of bluefish.
			   (laughing)
		   Get your fishing rod!


69	THE BEACH								69

	Several men have brought out their fishing gear, one's already
	casting.  Big blues flash wildly as the water bubbles and
	boils with activity...the blues are chasing bait fish.

	Stomping out of the water, Bunny spanks her wet rat of a dog.
	The fishermen connect as soon as their lines hit the water.

	Hoots and howls of excitement waft up to Brody as he stands
	there sweating and panting, staring in amazement at the sight
	before him.

				   BRODY
		   Oh, yeah...I didn't see....

	A little unsteady, he puts his gun away and starts to climb
	down.  People are watching him.

	The child is still crying.  Sean is embarrassed for his father.
	Peterson looks at Ellen.

				   PETERSON
			   (sarcastic)
		   Thorough at his job, isn't he?


70	BRODY									70

	drops down, his box of red-tipped bullets spilling out on
	the sand.  He brushes them off with too much concentration.

				   BRODY
			   (to the Mayor)
		   Sorry, Larry.

				   VAUGHAN
			   (helping
			   pick them up)
		   What the hell are these red things,
		   Martin?

				   BRODY
		   Cyanide.  There's cyanide inside...
		   can kill a shark instantly.

	Vaughan puts an understanding hand on his shoulder, and they
	walk beyond the tower, away from the crying.  People here
	and there are staring after Brody and talking among themselves.
	Reeves Vaughan comes up.

				   REEVES
		   Anything wrong, Dad?

				   VAUGHAN
			   (banishing his son
			   with a glance, then
			   to Brody)
		   Maybe you ought to take some time
		   off.  Before the summer really
		   starts.

				   BRODY
			   (gazes out
			   to sea)
		   Mine's already started.

71	BRODY HOUSE - PORCH - DUSK						71

	Head back, eyes closed, Brody is listening to the sound of the
	waves crashing on the beach.  A heavy wind has come up, turning
	the sky a deep red-purple.  Ellen joins him.

				   ELLEN
		   What do you want for dessert?

				   BRODY
		   Wheat fields, farms, big stretches
		   of land.

				   ELLEN
		   You want to move again.

				   BRODY
		   A little.

				   ELLEN
		   As in 'a little pregnant?'

				   BRODY
		   I don't know.  I've always lived
		   on an island.  I mean, Manhattan
		   is an island, too.

				   ELLEN
			   (amused)
		   That's true.  I never thought of
		   it that way.  How would you like
		   to take a walk with a person who
		   loves you?

							DISSOLVE TO


72	THE BEACH - ELLEN AND BRODY						72

	are walking along the edge of the water.  The ocean is
	luminescent.

				   BRODY
		   Look out there.  I wonder how many
		   sharks are spawned each year.
		   Millions probably.  Millions of
		   eating machines...And we're soft,
		   we're meat.  Did you ever think of
		   yourself as meat?

				   ELLEN
		   Well, as a matter of fact....

	He slips his arm around her and they walk a few steps in
	silence.  Far down the beach some kids have made a bonfire
	and are singing.

				   ELLEN
		   I wonder if they sense fear.  I
		   mean dogs sense fear, and I bet
		   sharks do too.

				   BRODY
		   Everything else attracts them, so
		   you know they're attracted by fear.
		   And if they are, we're in big
		   trouble.

				   ELLEN
		   Why?

				   BRODY
			   (fake chuckle)
		   Cause I'm really scared.

	She looks up at him...his face against the star-filled sky.

			  	   BRODY
		   I had a dream last night.  I was
		   on this sliver of sand in front of
		   a huge dune, a cliff really. that
		   went straight up with no shrubs or
		   anything to hold onto.  Then from a
		   long way out I saw a giant wave,
		   like a hundred stories high, coming.
		   So I tried to climb the cliff, but
		   the sand slipped through my fingers
		   and I fell.  And all the time the
		   wave was getting closer, and, you
		   know, higher -- until it almost
		   filled the sky.  But it wasn't the
		   wave I was afraid of.  It was what
		   was under the wave...and I had to
		   kill it, and then another one came.
		   And I had to kill that one too, and
		   I was afraid they'd come too fast
		   and I wouldn't have a chance.

	He stops and gazes out at the satiny black water.

				   BRODY
		   I can't stop looking out there.  I
		   try, but when I turn away from it,
		   I get this creepy feeling that it's
		   coming closer...so I have to keep
		   watching...you see I just can't
		   shake the idea, that it's waiting
		   for me, and it's going to get me.
		   Not just anyone, me.

				   ELLEN
			   (muffled)
		   For what reason?

				   BRODY
		   Because it wants revenge!  So call
		   the men in the white coats.  Hey!
		   Ellen!  Are you crying?  Why're
		   you crying?  I wasn't really serious.
		   I was just, oh hey don't cry.

				   ELLEN
		   If there's a shark that wants re-
		   venge he's sure getting it.

				   BRODY
		   What do you mean?

				   ELLEN
		   By making you feel like this.  That's
		   his revenge.  Somehow we've got to
		   put this thing behind us because
		   it's destroying us.  We can't live
		   like this anymore.  My God, Martin,
		   look at the state you're in.  No-
		   thing's happened for three years!

				   BRODY
		   Six people dead in a month.

				   ELLEN
		   Three years ago there was concrete
		   evidence...you know you're not
		   really sure now.

				   BRODY
		   Oh, he's there.
			   (looks out to
			   sea, his voice
			   rising)
		   He's out there and he's playing with
		   us!  Godammit I know that son-of-a-
		   bitch is out there!

73	AMITY VILLAGE - PRE-DAWN						73

	Street lights glow icily in the mist and go out with the first
	somber sign of dawn.

	A lone fisherman makes his way down to the dock.  One light
	still shines on the pier, its reflections reaching out into
	glassy swells where cabin cruisers swing from moorings in the
	harbor.  Japanese lanterns are strung like gems between the
	masts of a large yawl.

	And out there beyond the mouth of the harbor is the ocean,
	barely discernable in the grey light creeping in from the
	east.  Waves tumble and roll through the portal, bringing in
	the open sea.  Something is there, stealing along with the
	incoming tide.  Two gulls resting on a wooden piling lift off
	soundlessly.  Rigging creaks.  A dinghy scrapes ominously
	along the side of a yacht, and the Japanese lanterns sway back
	and forth.

	A bell-buoy tolls softly as the Shark slides unnoticed into
	the harbor.

	Mr. Sansom.

				   SANTINI
		   Yeah -- who got bit?  Who got ate?
		   The odds it happens again is
		   astronomical!

				   VAUGHAN
		   Surely he'll see that himself in
		   a week or two and straighten out.

				   MRS. TAFT
		   Look how he's acting.  You can't find
		   him when you need him -- he's always
		   up in that tower.  Maybe we should
		   get somebody who will take care of
		   the town!

				   VAUGHAN
		   I think you're jumping the gun.

				   MRS. TAFT
		   Oh, Larry...

				   PETERSON
			   (getting in his car)
		   Your loyalty's touching, Larry, but

	Gestures "it's up to you" and goes.  They watch him, then
	avoiding each others' eyes drift toward their cars.

				   MR. KAISER
		   I'll make some calls, see who's

		   What'll we do if they don't show

				   MIKE
		   They'll show, don't worry.  How
		   much we got left?

	Reeves Vaughan and three of his friends from Andover breeze
	by on their ten-speeds...too close and fast for comfort.

				   ANDY
			   (spitting)
		   Three bucks.

				   MIKE
		   And we need money for wine too.
			   (sophisticated)
		   Angela said they like white.

				   SEAN
		   I have three dollars, Mike.  You
		   could have it.  You could have my
		   allowance too, and I could go with
		   you guys, huh?

				   MIKE
		   How many times do I have to tell
		   you no?  NO, N.O.

				   SEAN
		   How're ya gonna get wine anyway?
		   You're not old enough.

				   ANDY
			   (to Sean)
		   Will you go drown or something.

	Andy's spitting has not gone unnoticed by Reeves.  He's
	turned around and come back.

				   REEVES
		   Did you spit at us?

				   ANDY
		   I?  Spit never crossed my lips.

	Mike, Andy and Sean continue on their way; the Andover boys
	keep pace on their bikes.

				   ANDOVER #1
		   Watch it, fat boy!

	Mike and Andy try to ignore them, but it's hard considering
	Andovers' need for a fight.  They reach the boat and busy
	themselves sorting out their goods.

				   ANDOVER #2
		   The metal in that kid's mouth alone
		   will sink their little dinghy, huh
		   Gordon?

				   ANDOVER #1
		   More likely the weight of his fat ass.

			   (coming up to him)
		   What did you say -- you conceited

		   Don't put your hands on me, Brody.
		   You know, you're not the only one
		   around here with a boat --

	One of the Andover boys is fooling with their sailing gear.

				   MIKE
			   (turning)
		   Hey!

	With that Reeves pushes Mike into the water.  Mike's cool
	vanishes.

				   MIKE
		   I'll kill you!

	Andy's glasses go flying as he tackles Reeves from behind
	throwing him down for a moment of glory, but then Reeves
	easily gets the better of him, mashing his face into the
	dock.  Sean flies to the rescue.

				   SEAN
			   (kicking Reeves)
		   You leave us alone.  I'm gonna

				   ANDOVER #2

		   A little shark bait.

	They hold Sean over the edge of the dock, kicking and scream-

	She's sulking.  It's a perfect day for sailing, and several
	boats are already out.  A large gray powerboat is passing
	offshore with rubber-suited figures on its deck.

				   ANGELA
		   What's that?

				   MIKE
			   (bitterly)
		   Skin-diving class.

	She turns over on her back and stares up at the clouds.  He
	moves closer and puts his arm across her.  She doesn't move.
	He leans over and gently touches her neck with his lips...
	she lets him.  Good.  Now his hands reach out for her breast,
	but she pushes him away and sits up.

				   MIKE
		   What's the matter?

				   ANGELA
		   I don't like to make a public
		   display of myself.

				   MIKE
		   Why don't we go back to my house?
		   I have the garage to myself.

				   ANGELA
		   The garage?  How enticing!  How
		   romantic!

				   MIKE
	Mike is embarrassed, searching for something to say.

				   MIKE
		   There's always Pine Groves.

				   ANGELA
		   And wade through bodies?  You just
		   sit on the ground there, you get
		   pregnant.

	She sighs, turns over on her stomach, brushing him with her
	big breasts, and stares out to sea again.

				   ANGELA
		   See, I thought we'd go out to some
		   place where nobody goes.  Someplace
		   special, you know what I mean?

				   MIKE
		   Yeah.  Winter Island.  Nobody there.

				   ANGELA
		   We could bring a picnic and a
		   blanket.  And wine...nice and
		   cool.  And you know, like that
		   ...all alone.

	She pulls him down on top of her and kisses him full on the
	mouth.

				   ANGELA
			   (smiling, whispering
			   in his ear)
		   I really like you, Mike.

	She quickly pushes him away again, but looks at him out of
	the corner of her eye.  He's beside himself.

				   MIKE
		   Yeah.  Well, maybe we could.  I
		   mean I can really do what I want
		   anyway.  I just don't like to
		   upset my father, but I...ah, I
		   can do what I want.

86	AT SEA									86

	The gray dive boat drops anchor, eight rubber-suited divers
	aboard.

	Tom Andrews (the diving instructor Brody spoke to by the
	pool) and Andrews' Assistant are helping the student divers
	put on tanks and weight belts.  They're a mixed group -- half
	adults, half teenagers.

				   ANDREWS
		   You won't see much today, not much
		   visibility -- but don't let that
		   make you nervous.

	One of the boys is a little wide-eyed with excitement.

				   ASSISTANT
		   You okay?
			   (the boy nods)
		   And how do you tell me that under
		   the water?

	The boy gives the okay sign.

				   ANDREWS
		   Right, over you go.  Stick with
		   your buddies.

	The class backrolls in one by one.

				   ASSISTANT
		   Coming?

				   ANDREWS
		   Go ahead.  I'm gonna try to get
		   dinner.

	The Assistant backrolls in and joins the scuba divers on the
	surface.  He signals "Down!"

	Andrews picks up a spear gun and giant-steps into the water.
	He swims looking down, cocking the spear gun.


87	UNDERWATER								87

	from Andrews' point of view:  the divers descending, nearly
	obscured in the murk.  One looks up and waves.  Concerned by
	the poor visibility, Andrews drops down to join them.  He
	glides from one pair of buddies to the other, giving and re-
	ceiving the okay sign.  He can tell from the bubbles that one
	woman's breathing is too rapid -- she needs a bit of calming,
	so Andrews takes her arm for a moment, exaggeratedly breathing
	along with her more slowly...Okay?  Okay.

	They all descend lower.

88	BRODY GARAGE								88

	Mike Brody and Andy are sneaking the sailing equipment out.
	A clatter as something is kicked -- "sshh!" -- they head
	toward the road.  Sean appears.

				   SEAN
			   (whispering)
		   I'm coming with you, right?

				   MIKE
		   Get outa here.

				   SEAN
		   Please, oh Mike, please!
			   (but they just
			   keep moving, so
			   he turns to go
			   inside)
		   Okay, I'm telling Mom.

				   MIKE
			   (alarmed)
		   You are not!

				   SEAN
		   Yes I am.

	Pause.

				   MIKE
			   (giving in)
		   What the hell....

89	UNDERWATER								89

	The diving class explores the murk.  Andrews shakes his head,
	the visibility is just too poor this far down;  he signals to
	his Assistant -- take them up to 25 feet and level off...

	They obey, Andrews watching them ascend, staying down to ob-
	serve how they do it -- glancing for a moment at a school of
	mackerel streaking by him at top speed ---

	From his point of view, we see the divers 20 feet above him,
	and up beyond them, very dimly, on the surface, the hull
	of the dive-boat.


90	ANDREWS									90

	looks up, then down at his watch and depth gauge.  His eyes
	widen as he sees something below him:  down in the murk, a
	big striped bass.  He shoots and misses.  The lunker bass
	takes off and he follows in hot pursuit to deeper water.  The
	striper easily outswims him.  It slows, he takes aim and it
	streaks off again, darting back and forth below him.  He
	shouldn't be doing this, leaving his students for so long,
	but this fish is a beauty.  He follows it down.  For a moment,
	he loses it in cloudy water, then his eyes widen with horror
	at what he sees below him ---


91	THE GREAT WHITE SHARK							91

	looms up out of the darkness with the striper in its mouth.
	One side of the Shark's massive head, charred and knotted by
	scars, has hardened into hideous armor.

	Enraged, blackened from dorsal to mouth, white teeth flashing,
	staring up at him, the Shark rises like a mad beast.

	Andrews panics...finning backward and tearing at his weight
	belt to ditch it, he pulls the inflator cord of his safety
	vest.  Instantly it swells up and he surges upward, eyes shut
	tight, not exhaling.  He pumps past the other divers, and
	shoots to the surface.


92	THE DIVERS								92

	looking up at him...at each other...what's going on?
	The Assistant signals:  Ascend.  As they carefully rise ---


93	SURFACE									93

	Andrews unconscious, bleeding from the nose, bobbing on the
	surface.

	The Assistant and the other divers come up.  A boy waves
	desperately for the boat to come as the Assistant tries to
	pry the mouthpiece from Andrews' teeth.

94	HARBOR									94

	Angela arrives to find several sailboats are being made ready.
	Brooke is watching Mike and Andy prepare Mike's catamaran.

				   MIKE
		   No sweat.  Once we're out there,
		   we'll ditch 'em.

				   ANGELA
			   (meaning Andy
			   and Brooke)
		   What about them?

				   ANDY
		   We have our own things to do.

				   SEAN

		   Are we ready to go yet?

				   MIKE
		   You know, Sean, I'm worried.  I
		   think someone better stand guard
		   on that corner.

				   SEAN
		   I'll do it!

	He dashes off, passing two girls (Kathy and Laura) who are
	sliding their sailboat into the water.  They look jealously
	at Angela, whose windbreaker, jeans and sneakers are all black.

				   KATHY
		   Gawd.  The Black Dahlia.

				   LAURA
		   I'm not bitter.  I fell out of love
		   with Mike a long time ago.

	A thump from one of the boats, followed by giggles and a
	"sshh" and we see ---


97	ED AND TINA'S SAILBOAT							97

	They aren't visible.

				   SOMEBODY (o.s.)
		   Hey!  What're you two doin' in

		   Come on, Brooke!  Mike's gotta get

				   BROOKE
		   That's okay, I'm, uh -- goin' with

				   ANDY
		   Oh, great.

				   ANGELA
		   Thanks a lot, Brooke!

	They watch her skulk off with the embarrassed Polo to a sleek
	little sloop.

				   ANDY
		   Another rejection.  Spurned even by
		   scuzz.

				   ANGELA
			   (to Mike)
		   So it's just the three of us, then?

				   ANDY
		   Hey, don't worry about me.  We get

				   SEAN

				   MIKE
		   Sorry, but there just isn't

				   MIKE

	Sean pulls a fit.

			   rolls on the dock)
		   Please!  I can't stand it!  You're

				   MIKE
		   This won't do you any good.

	Kathy and Laura stick up for Sean.

				   KATHY
		   Don't be a rat, Mike.

				   ANDY
			   (a dark look

		   Promises are made to be broken.
		   I should know.

	Sean watches his brother's catamaran raise sail and begin to
	slide away.

		   That's okay, you can come with us.

102	EXT. DIVE BOAT AT DOCK - DAY						102

	In the boat a Physician kneeling over Andrews, working on
	him...no response...Brody and the Assistant close by, the
	other divers on the dock, shivering and watching...The
	Physician rises.

				   PHYSICIAN
			   (to Brody)
		   I'd say an embolism.  Air breaking
		   through into the bloodstream,
		   bubbles reaching his brain.
			   (shrugs helplessly)
		   The way he came up, without
		   exhaling ---

				   BRODY
		   How could that happen, though?
		   Tom was an instructor, experi-
		   enced ---

				   PHYSICIAN
		   Any diver can panic.  I'm a diver
		   myself and a good one and I know
		   that just a sudden sense of being
		   down there can do it.  Or maybe
		   equipment failure ---

				   ASSISTANT
			   (with Andrews'
			   tank and regulator)
		   It wasn't that.
			   (presses the purge
			   valve:  a hiss of
			   air)
		   Working perfectly.

	Brody examines the mouthpiece:  we can see it's been bitten
	half through.

				   PHYSICIAN
		   Consistent with panic.  Biting
		   down like that, intake of breath,
		   feeling you have to surface.  It's
		   a kind of claustrophobia.

				   ASSISTANT
		   Yeah, I've had it sometimes.  Not
		   as bad as Tom, though....

	Brody's own panic is visibly surging as the ambulance arrives.

103	SAILBOATS AT SEA							103

	Some boats are already tacking around when Mike's catamaran
	and the others get there.  An athletic Redhead is alone on
	a little Sunfish.  Doug is also single-handed in his tiny
	inflatable.  A brisk wind is blowing, there's a light chop,
	and it's clouding up.

	The Tornado turns about, revealing its captain, Reeves Vaughan.

				   ANDY
		   Aw, shit.

	ineptly.

				   ED
		   No, Tina, let me take her.

				   TINA
		   All right, Hercules, you got it.

	She simply lets go of sail and rudder.  The boom whips
	around.  Ed catches it, gives her a look as they switch
	positions.

	He's trying to get the boat lined up...a long blast from
	the whistle, a cheer, and the others are off.  Ed slaps the
	hull as if it were the flank of a horse ---

118	SAILBOAT WITH TWO GIRLS AND SEAN BRODY					118

	Sean's wearing a lifejacket.  His mood has changed and he's

	side, harnessing herself so she hangs way out over water.
	Even with the two of them there, the pontoon only skims the surface.

119	ED AND TINA'S SAILBOAT							119

	This is the straggler:  Tina has taken over again, clumsily
	zig-zagging, letting out too much sail.  The music from the

	tiller, he's trying to rudder around...the boat slews
	sideways...Ed half rises, grabs for the rigging, staring
	at the fin -- and the wind-filled sail comes whizzing back
	at him, the boom knocking him overboard...Tina screams.

	gasping the water, lunges for the boat, but it's drawing
	away, and the fin is turning towards him...we glimpse the
	other boats, they're too far to see or hear a thing.  Ed
	tries to flail toward the boat.  A tremor ripples down the
	Shark's marble body.  One quick thrust of its tail and it
	turns -- we see the hideously mottled side of its massive
	head.  The giant is homing in...Tina screams ---

134	ED AND TINA'S SAILBOAT							134

	seems to be sailing itself, a ghost boat rolling with the
	swells, its rudder drifting back and forth.  Without direction,
	the sail billows first one way, the swings completely across
	to the other side.  The P.D. Boat approaches.

				   BRODY
		   Hello?

	No answer.  Hendricks eases them a little closer.  The sailboat
	is empty...and eerie, with its sail slapping.  They draw the
	sailboat toward them with a hook and Brody boards it.  At
	first, only her arm is visible.  Brody kneels and there cowering
	in the crawl space under the deck, is Tina.

				   BRODY
			  (softly)
		   What's the matter, honey...huh?
		   ...Come on...

	No response.  Her eyes stare at him wide with terror.

				   BRODY
			   (to Hendricks)
		   We gotta get her in.

	He tries to move her from under the deck.  She hangs on.  As
	gently as he can, he tries to pry her hands loose.  She starts
	to whimper.  He keeps going.

	now -- he proceeds to stamp away at the foot pump as hard
	and fast as he can.  Passed by everyone on the way out, now
	he's passed again by everyone on the way back.

	First, the girls' boat with Sean:

				   LAURA
			   (passing)
		   Haven't I seen you someplace before?

	This cracks Sean up.  Doug ignores them -- keeps pumping.
	Then the Redhead, slowing a little as she passes:

				   REDHEAD
		   You need help?  Wind's backing
		   around.

	He shakes his head and she goes on.  Then Polo's sloop:

				   POLO

	Reeves' Tornado is already turning in that direction.

				   ANDY

		   Easier than beating our way back

		   Too late, I've already had it.

	Homing in, the Shark circles upward, the thudding louder as
	the beast rises toward it...then still louder ending with an
	explosive sound ---


178	SURFACE									178

	Hoots of laughter at Doug:  the compartment has burst and he's
	standing up in chagrin;  no danger of sinking, he's still water-
	tight.  And now:


179	THE FIN									179

	rears above the surface.  He sees it gliding toward him,
	tail hissing through the water.

	Mike's catamaran is heading straight at him ---

				   DOUG
		   Help!!  Help!!

	Doug's holding onto his mast, watching the fin.  It dips,
	then comes up right beside him and slices through the other
	compartment of his inflatable...air rushing out....


180	TWO BOATS								180

	converge as they hurry toward him, collide with each other...
	sails flying free...shouts...bumping and pushing....


181	CLOSE - DOUG								181

	He's frantically turning to see where Mike is, then he's
	whirled up along with his boat through the air ---


182	CLOSE - MIKE AND ANDY							182

	appalled at the sight ahead ---


183	THE SHARK								183

	has seized the inflatable in its jaws, shaking it like a
	terrier with a rat in its mouth.  Doug can't hold on.  He's
	pitched into the water and swims toward Mike's boat for all
	he's worth.


184	MIKE'S CATAMARAN							184

	heading toward Doug ---

				   MIKE
			   (terrified)
		   Where is it?  Where'd it go?

	They reach out and grab Doug -- the boat tips...screams...
	Mike throws himself across to balance as Doug struggles onto
	the catamaran.

	The demolished inflatable bobs to the surface.

				   ANDY
		   Head away from that.

	But which was is safe to go?

				   MIKE
		   WHERE IS IT?

				   ANDY
		   Hurry!  Just go!

	The other boats are coming on ---

				   ANDY
			   (has Mike's whistle)
		   Warn them ---

	He gives a blast and all at once the catamaran beneath them
	is lifted out of the water.  The four of them are first
	hurled to one side -- Mike bangs his head -- and then, as
	their boat capsizes, they're all four pitched into the sea.


185	OVERTURNED CATAMARAN							185

	Three heads bob up, swiveling around to see -- and with
	horror they do see ---


186	THE SHARK AT EYE LEVEL							186

	weaving around them.  Their catamaran is drifting.  The
	three of them thrash toward it, the fin on the other side
	of it now, coming back.  They claw at the hull.  Doug
	scrambles up and reaches back for Angela.  Andy wallows
	onto the canvas stretched between the pontoons.

	The three of them gasp for breath, looking around wildly ---

				   ANDY
		   Where's Mike??

	He's floating half-conscious back where they turned over.


187	POLO'S SLOOP								187

	tacking swiftly toward him, Polo leaning out to grab him,
	scared, looking for the fin ---


188	OTHER BOATS								188

	maneuver in confusion.  One is getting away.

	The girls with Sean are terror-stricken.  Turning to flee
	the scene, they cut across the path of boats going to help.
	A near collision with one -- and they plow straight into
	the side of another, almost impaling its occupant.


189	THE SHARK								189

	is circling.  A skiff veers too sharply into the wind and
	turns over, tumbling two boys into the sea.


190	POLO'S SLOOP								190

	is running for it with Mike aboard.  Coming to, Mike looks
	around -- where are the rest of them?

				   MIKE
			   (yelling)
		   SEAN!!?
			   (to Polo)
		   We gotta go back.

	Polo keeps going.


191	TWO BOYS								191

	are climbing onto the hull of their overturned skiff.  The
	Shark angles toward them with short lashes of its crescent
	tail.  They draw their legs up, cringing...a jarring impact
	as the giant snout bashes their hull.


192	REEVES' TORNADO								192

	appears, swinging in between the overturned boats.  He's
	holding a coil of rope, not sure where to throw it.  He flings
	it toward the skiff, then staggers backward as the fin slices
	by a few feet in front of him, nearly as tall as he is.

	The girls with Sean are kicking the splintered dinghy, trying
	to free it from their bow.

	Andy flings a line to them.

				   ANDY
		   Pull all the boats togeth...

	Another butting charge by the Shark knocks him to his knees.
	A scream of pain as Angela is thrown into a center board.

193	BOATS CONVERGING							193

	Reeves sails his Tornado up onto the half-submerged frame of
	the catamaran.

				   ANDY
		   Pull in -- throw that line over
		   there ---

	The boats all draw together:  Reeves pulls in the capsized
	skiff.  The girls haul in.  The Redhead's Sunfish is the
	last boat in.

				   ANDY
			   (to Redhead)
		   Lash that to your mast!
			   (she hesitates)
		   We have to tie them up!  All of
		   them!!

				   REDHEAD
		   No -- !

				   ANDY
		   Alone nobody has a chance!!

	Two boys leap onto her Sunfish, tip it on its side, and
	lash her mast to theirs, making a barrier.

	Panicky disorder.  Sails rip, rigging tangles.  Boats are
	hauled on top of other boats and lashed haphazardly together.
	A hopefully protective little island.

				   SEAN
			   (to Angela)
		   You're bleeding.

	She looks down.  The slash isn't deep.

				   SEAN
			   (softly to Andy)
		   Where's Mike?

				   ANDY
		   He's okay.

				   ANGELA
		   They got away.

	She looks into the boy's terrified eyes...at the fearful
	faces of the others watching for the next attack...what have
	they gotten into?  Screams as the Shark, unseen below, butts
	the raft of boats.

	Andy lifts himself up to the top of the heap.

				   ANDY
		   Here!  Everybody up here!

	Angela helps Sean up -- the others are scurrying up now too.
	Clinging to the pile of boats:  six boys and four girls, cold
	wet, shivering, the full extent of their predicament hitting
	them.  Angela scans the ocean, and we see from her point of
	view the two escaping boats, distant now, making for Winter
	Island.  One of them is Polo's sloop, its back sail gliding
	through the haze like the fin of a shark.

	A splintering crash again rocks the floating island.  Kids grab
	onto anything they can.  The Redhead slips down into the water
	between boats.  The Shark hits the sailboats again, pinning her
	legs, grinding them between gunnels, the blow jolting Sean down
	into a swamped dinghy where Reeves is trying to detach the mast.

	Before Sean can get back up, the Shark hits again...and again...
	the battering coming too fast for anyone to hold on.  They fall,
	clutching at anything, shouting, slipping...And then it stops.

	The Redhead is gone.  A dark cloud billows up in the water be-
	tween the boats where she disappeared.  Silence.  The "raft"
	rocks gently.

	She looks toward Winter Island.  It's farther away now --
	only a line of the horizon, disappearing in the dusk.

				   BOY
		   We're drifting -- !

				   ANGELA
		   I'm sure they went to get help.

				   BOY
		   If they made it.

				   ANGELA
		   Somebody'll spot them...

	Sean is shivering.  Angela takes off her windbreaker and
	puts it around him.  She's wearing a halter top.  Something
	is hanging out of it.

				   SEAN
		   What's that?

	She looks down to see, trailing from under her left breast, a
	nylon stocking.  Gasping, she stuffs it back in, but it's too
	late.  They've seen.  Everyone knows her secret...falsies.
	Reeves wears a stupid grin.

				   ANGELA
		   So what?  Big deal.

				   REEVES
		   No.  Small deal.

	The rigging creaks with a gentle shifting of the "raft."

				   ANDY
		   It's back!

	They brace themselves.  A long scraping from below and then,
	very slowly, as the Shark runs its body against submerged
	areas, the "raft" begins to rotate.  A flapping sail starts
	to tear along a seam.  And then, as they turn away from the
	wind, all the booms swing violently across at once.  They're
	turning in a circle.

				   ANGELA
			   (softly)
		   What's it DOING?

	For a moment, nothing.  Then, thirty yards away, the fin
	appears.

				   BOY
			   (to Reeves)
		   HURRY!

	They wrench the mast free.  Reeves carries it to the edge
	of the raft, looking to his right --

				   ANDY
		   No, this side!  This side!

	Reeves turns toward it, bracing himself.  Behind him, the others
	watch as he holds the mast out over the water like a lance,
	following the movement of the fin.  The raft is still turning
	enough to make it hard for him.  The Shark speeds in.  Reeves
	stumbles to the best footing he can find, aims the mast, dips
	it below the surface -- and shudderingly connects.  It hardly
	checks the Shark's momentum.  Reeves is barely able to main-
	tain his grip on the mast as the whole floating conglomeration
	is shoved through the water for a few seconds.

	Reeves lowers the mast, wincing in pain.

				   REEVES
		   My ribs --

	Andy takes the mast as the Shark circles again.  Andy braces.
	He's scared.  And here it comes.

	Andy lowers the mast, but this charge is even more ferocious.
	The impact drives the mast back through his hands and arms,
	friction-burning.  He nearly drops it.  The castaways perched
	above him cling on through the impact, watching the battle,
	still frightened, but feeling less like sitting ducks since
	some opposition is being offered.

	And now the Shark comes in for the third time.  Again Andy
	aims the mast -- but this time, the Shark seizes it in its
	jaws, biting down with an awful crunch.  He holds on as the
	Shark jerks the mast from side to side sending up showers of
	spray.  He's nearly pulled overboard, then hurled back stunned,
	the bent mast yanked out of his grasp and sent flying high in
	the air.

	He gingerly climbs to join the huddled group...watching and
	waiting.  There's nothing they can do...but keep their eyes
	riveted on the relentlessly circling fin....

	The P.D. Boat reduces speed as it nears Winter Island.  Hauled
	up out of the rocky surf are the two escaped sailboats.  Faint
	shouts.  Brody can barely make out the form of the Kids in
	the dusk.

				   BRODY
			   (peering tensely,
			   calling)
		   MIKE?!  SEAN?

	More clearly now, he can see five figures of equal size, no
	Sean.  Three boys and two girls, yelling and waving their arms.

				   MIKE
			   (calling)
		   Yeah, Dad!

				   BRODY
			   (shouting ahead)
		   Mike!  Where's Sean?

	The Kids are yelling but he can't hear them over the motor
	and the waves crashing on the rocks.

				   BRODY
		   What?  Where are the others?

	They start to splash out to him, but Brody signals them to stay
	where they are.

	He carefully threads his way closer to shore.  He's within
	hearing range now and can make out what they're saying.

				   MIKE
		   They're between here and the Cape!
		   Get out there quick, Dad!  There's
		   a shark...

				   BRODY
			   (grabs the radio-
			   phone)
		   MAYDAY!  MAYDAY!  MAYDAY!


199	LONG SHOT - THE P.D. BOAT						199

	is broadside to the Kids, slowly turning as they climb aboard.
	Brody's on the radio, his words lost in the surf.  The boat's
	getting closer to the rocks.


200	CLOSE - BRODY								200

	does his best to hold the boat where it is ---

				   BRODY
			   (on radio)
		   Somewhere between here and the Cape!
		   Send your chopper out and tell me
		   where, I'll get to them -- over.
			   (starting to turn
			   the boat around,
			   he calls to Mike)
		   Is Sean all right?

				   MIKE
		   I don't know, I didn't see!
		   Hurry, Dad!

	A grinding from below.  The boat's on the rocks.  He reverses,
	rips back across, tries forward again -- stops.  He's aground.

							CUT TO


201	THE SAILBOATS								201

	The whole heap is violently rocking -- the Shark is bashing
	from below now, unseen, as the fear-numbed castaways regroup
	themselves, getting up as high on the flotsam as they can.

				   ANDY
			   (trying to encourage)
		   We're getting closer to it ---

	A sand bar is a quarter-mile away.

				   DOUG
			   (bitterly)
		   No, we're going to pass it ---

				   ANDY
		   Maybe the wind will change ---

	Suddenly, the sound of a helicopter...they all look up.


202	FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW - HELICOPTER					202

	coming in through thickening fog.


203	THE BOATS								203

	all waving and yelling ---


204	HELICOPTER COCKPIT							204

	Spotter looking down, aghast...as Pilot reports on radio.

				   PILOT
		   Position is six point three miles
		   -- zero four one degrees of
		   Queepecket Light ---


205	FROM CHOPPER'S POINT OF VIEW						205

	The castaways on the piled-up boats and the fin.

				   SPOTTER
		   My God!


206	COCKPIT									206

				   SPOTTER
			   (to Pilot)
		   Better get 'em to that sand bar ---

				   PILOT
			   (nods)
		   Proceeding to assist ---


207	HELICOPTER AND BOATS							207

	The chopper swoops down toward them.  They're cheering.  It
	descends to 20 feet directly above them, but the down rush
	of buffeting air from the rotor is clearly a danger as the
	precarious structure rocks and tips.  The Kids scream, and
	the chopper skitters a short distance away.  It touches down,
	rotor still turning.  The Spotter opens the hatch.

				   SPOTTER
			   (over loud-
			   hailer)
		   Okay, we'll put you on the sand
		   bar, two at a time.  First two
		   down to the waterline, let's
		   go.

	A moment of indecision on the boats, then ---

				   SIDEBURNS
			   (to two girls)
		   Move it.

	They make their way to the edge of the floating heap,
	anxiously scanning the surface around them.  The chopper
	begins to approach.  Then Sideburns spots it, the fin,
	surfacing on the far side of the chopper, coming toward it ---

				SIDEBURNS
			   (shrieking and
			   pointing)
		   Look out!  Look out!

	The Spotter can't hear over the chopper's noise.  He
	glances around confused.  Then he sees it, head on, breaking
	the surface ---

				   SPOTTER
			   (to Pilot)
		   Lift off!

	But before the Pilot can gain any height, the charging Shark
	fastens onto the chopper's substructure.  Engine shrilling,
	metal squealing, the chopper heaves and yaws, the upward
	thrust of its rotor fighting the pull of the Shark -- and
	suddenly this sends it flipping over, upside down into the sea.
	The Spotter, thrown clear, comes choking to the surface.


208	UNDERWATER								208

	Bent askew but still turning, the rotor chews its way into
	the body of the helicopter like some prehistoric creature
	destroying itself.  The glass bubble of the cockpit
	begins to fill with water.  Upside down and half-conscious,
	the Pilot struggles with his seat belt.  The whirling blades
	bite through the metal...dark fuel rises in an oily cloud
	and spreads toward the surface.


209	HIGH ANGLE								209

	The rotary action causes the thing to crawl in an arc.  It
	lodges in a tangle of superstructure and spars against the
	"raft" of sailboats.  The blades stop.  A wisp of smoke
	trails up from the belly.

	The Spotter swims through smudges of fuel which are rapidly
	extending themselves across the surface of the water.


210	UNDERWATER - SHARK'S POINT OF VIEW					210

	The Spotter strokes toward the sailboats, but the Shark slides
	toward him faster than he moves toward safety.


211	SAILBOATS								211

	The Kids desperately cheer him on.  He's getting close.


212	THE SPOTTER								212

	is raised half out of the water by a terrible force, flung
	from side to side bellowing with terror, then suddenly released.
	He hangs for a moment in the water, gasping for breath.
	He's injured, but there's nothing to do but keep swimming...
	a stroke...another...then it happens again.

	The fuel has reached the sailboats and the partly submerged
	decks of some of them are slippery with it.  Half wading,
	splashing, slipping, the Kids try to hold out a boom, some
	rigging anything for the Spotter to grab...but he's too far
	away and anyway, he's no longer swimming...just kind of rest-
	in the water as if he's thinking hard about something
	or other.


213	UNDERWATER								213

	The glass bubble fills with water and smoke too rapidly for
	the dazed Pilot to free himself.  He fights for consciousness.
	Hanging upside down, he sees through the glass an indistinguish-
	able form.  At first shadowy and veiled, materializing as it
	approaches, mouth working as if gasping for breath, the Great
	White comes right up to the glass and hangs there, gills rip-
	pling.  A tiny sucker fish holds fast to the unburned side of
	the slack, grinning jaw.  The Shark's black, deadly eye is
	riveted on the Pilot as he breathes in water.


214	SAILBOATS								214

	Andy goes in after the wounded Spotter.  He swims toward him
	cautiously...closer and still no Shark...he swims harder, a
	little splashing...careful...closer, he almost has him...
	he reaches....

	And suddenly, the Spotter lunges, grabbing the boy in the death
	hug of a drowning, dying full-grown man.

	A half-second later, the Shark hits full force and Andy's alone
	in bloody water...A shower of flaming chunks of metal descends
	as the helicopter's belly erupts in a volcano of exploding
	fuel.

	The fire spreads across the water in jagged leaps.

	The raft of sailboats is on fire.  Slick places in the water
	smolder.  By the time he makes it back to the boats, Andy's
	shoulders have been singed.

	The Kids have nothing adequate to hold water to fling on the
	flames that are consuming the helicopter and rapidly spreading
	through the tangled rigging and sails of their "raft."

	The heat is unbearable at such close quarters.  The surrounding
	fog glows an angry hot pink.

				   ANGELA
		   I can't stand this -- I'm going in.

				   GIRL
		   No --

				   ANGELA
		   I'm not gonna burn to death.

	She goes in.  They wait for the attack, but nothing happens.
	It gets hotter by the second.

				   REEVES
		   I'm going in too.

	He slips in and hangs onto the raft, looking about terrified.
	No shark.  Oily smoke twists up from flaming nautical plastics.
	Some of the Kids try breathing through wet clothing wrapped
	across their faces.  The unbearable heat forces them all into
	the water.  Their "raft" is riding lower.  Crying and scared,
	Sean is held tight by one of the girls.


215	UNDERWATER								215

	The Kids hang on the surface like parasites around the rim of
	the glowing "raft."

							CUT TO


216	OFF WINTER ISLAND - THE P.D. BOAT					216

	is still on the rocks.  The Kids are in the water, working to
	free it.  Brody is on the radiophone.

				   BRODY
		   Why -- what's wrong?

				   COAST GUARD (v.o.)
		   We don't know.  The chopper's just
		   not answering.  It went dead.

	In agonizing frustration, Brody stares off.  In the distance,
	the sky is lit with a pink glow.  The Kids stop working --

				   SOMEONE (v.o.)
		   What's that?

							CUT TO


217	THE "RAFT" OF SAILBOATS							217

	is still on fire, the castaways hanging off it.  Doug and Andy
	grab lungsfull of air, and dive.


218	UNDERWATER - THEIR POINT OF VIEW					218

	Great dark forms of the broken boats hang beneath the surface,
	the sail billowing downward in the current.  No sign of the
	Shark.  The boys swim as fast as they can under the "raft."

	They come up in a pocket of air trapped beneath the overturned
	catamaran, groping blindly in maddening little compartments
	until they find what they came for, a fire extinguisher.  The
	body of the Pilot hangs upside down, head nodding in the water-
	filled glass bubble.  Gasping, Doug and Andy speed to the surface.


219	LONG SHOT								219

	The glow in the fog diminishes as they get the fire under
	control.


220	CLOSER									220

	Wisps of smoke trail from charred rigging.  One by one, the
	Kids pull themselves back onto the raft, watching, always
	watching the water.  Cold and wet, there is still a glimmer
	of hope as they huddle together in the night air.

				   ANDY
		   I think it's gone.

				   SOMEONE
		   Maybe the explosion scared it off.


							CUT TO


221	OFF WINTER ISLAND - THE P.D. BOAT					221

	Mike and the others are in the water rocking the boat -- it
	grates off the rocks and floats free.  Brody starts the engine
	immediately, and turns the boat around, Mike climbing aboard...

				   BRODY
		   No, stay here.

				   MIKE
		   But I have to help you...I shouldn't
		   have taken the boat out...I'm respon...

				   BRODY
			   (hugs him)
		   That doesn't matter, Mike.  You stay
		   here.  At least I know you're safe.

				   MIKE
			   (near tears, looks
			   at his father)
		   But I don't want you to go, Dad.
		   I'm afraid for you...

				   BRODY
		   I'll pick you up.  On the way back.
		   Okay?
			   (Mike nods)


222	MIKE									222

	jumps down and makes his way to shore, Brody keeping his
	searchlight on him until he reaches land...Mike turns a
	worried face to him and waves.  They look at each other.
	They may never see each other again...

							CUT TO


223	RAFT OF SAILBOATS - NIGHT						223

	Still no sign of the Shark.  Just black water, wind in the
	rigging, the terror and mystery of the sea at night.  The
	Kids are still...a few asleep or trying to...everything's
	quiet, except for Reeves' labored breathing.  Sean is looking
	at him.  He hasn't forgotten the older boy threw him in the
	water.  Reeves meets his eyes, and for a long inscrutable
	moment, their gazes lock...nothing is said.

							CUT TO


224	AT SEA - P.D. BOAT - BRODY						224

	sees something ahead, slows down.  Seagulls are sleeping on
	the water, but there's something else there, drifting...a
	shapeless object.  Fearing the worst, he cuts his motor and
	turns his spotlight on it.  Doug's demolished inflatable.
	He snags it with a boathook and lifts the thing a little.  In
	the beam of light:  a great jagged curve where the Shark has
	bitten through.  Brody is frozen.  It's not a dream, he's
	coming closer, closer to the real thing, closer to death.  In
	the water, there's a soft lapping, a slapping sound.  He turns
	his beam...around the inflatable, a small shark...another...
	another...

	He spears down at them impotently with the pole.  Suddenly, a
	rush of wings as all around him the sleeping gulls lift off,
	whirring in confusion through the beam of his light and scream-
	ing off into the night.

	Silence again.  Then, all at once, the little sharks disappear.
	It's here.  Brody knows it's here...

	He carefully reaches for his gun...eases the safety off.  For
	an eternity, nothing happens.  Brody is ready.  The boat lifts
	gently with a passing swell -- the dragging rake creaks in its
	brace.  He drifts and waits...poised...

	He turns the lights off.  In the darkness, the sound of water
	lapping, the wind, and a soft metallic click:  his gun is
	cocked.

	He stirs the water with the boathook...nothing happens.  Draw-
	ing a deep breath, he reaches carefully down with his hand and
	brushes the surface with his fingers.  Gaining courage, he
	gives a tentative pat, then more...he slaps at the surface.
	His gun ready, he puts his hand all the way in and flutters
	it like a wounded fish.  He turns the searchlight on and
	shines it in the water...nothing there but his hand, stone-
	white, enlarged, and dead-looking in the water.

	Maybe he's wrong.  Maybe it's not here and he's losing valuable
	time...he'd better get the Kids.  He goes to start the boat --
	and there's a low scraping sound against the hull.  Scanning
	the water, he sees nothing.  Again the pulling beneath him,
	stronger this time.  Brody raises the gun, and throws the
	motor on.  There...a glimpse of the fin in the spotlight!  Two
	quick shots smack the water and the Shark is gone.


225	CHASE									225

	Brody pursues the ghostly form through the fog.  It glides
	before him like a reflection of the moon racing across the
	water, leading him as much as fleeing, a dark mirage that he
	follows with a strange elation, curving after it first one
	way, then another, never quite getting a shot...becoming hope-
	lessly turned around.

	Pushing the throttle hard, aiming his gun, he closes in on the
	Shark, but it sounds, disappearing like an apparition.  He
	races ahead, turns back, turns around in every direction look-
	ing for the Shark, fighting to control the wheel, the gun held
	loosely in his hand --


226	A BUTTING CHARGE							226

	by the Shark lifts the bow off the water, throws Brody against
	the rail --


227	THE GUN									227

	flies up into the air and spirals down with an irretrievable
	plop into the water.

	He can't believe it...beats at the boat with his fists.

				   BRODY
			   (roaring)
		   You son of a bitch!

	He looks around.  Out of sight of everything, completely turned
	around...he's lost.  He cuts the motor and drifts in silence.
	He reaches for the radio.  And then he hears it...very faint,
	in the distance...a whistle, a police whistle, faint but
	unmistakable.  Brody listens...peers out into the fog...
	listens again.

							CUT TO


228	RAFT OF SAILBOATS							228

	Andy is blowing the whistle.  About to give another blast, he
	breaks off --

				   ANDY
		   Lights.

	Rigid and silent, the gaze out to sea.  There through the fog,
	a glowing aura from the lights of the oncoming P.D. Boat.
	It's turning toward them --

				   SOMEONE
		   They see us!!

	Shouts and cheers.  From somewhere in the wreckage there's an
	ominous creak.  They stiffen, looking down --

				   SOMEONE
		   It's underneath us -- !

				   SIDEBURNS
			   (pauses, listening)
		   No, something shifted.


229	P.D. BOAT AND SAILBOATS							229

	Brody sees silhouetted against the fog, the group on the
	floating wreckage, twenty yards ahead.  They're calling
	to him to hurry.  His eyes strain to see if his son is
	there --

				   BRODY
			   (calling)
		   Are you all right?

				   SEAN
		   Daddy!  Help, Daddy!  Help!

	Brody sees him now, standing up, smaller than the others...He
	looks okay.  Brody almost weeps with relief.

				   BRODY
		   Are you all right?

				   SEAN
		   Yes!  But I'm scared -- get me off
		   of here!!

				   BRODY
		   Okay Sean, don't worry, I'll get
		   you!  Is everybody safe?

				   ANDY
		   No.


230	UNDERWATER - THE "RAFT"							230

	The downward sail sways in the current.  A boom swings.  The
	burned helicopter still hangs there.  High above us, Brody's
	hull comes alongside the jagged wreckage.


231	SURFACE									231

	Too many Kids try to get off at once.  They rush toward the
	edge, cling as the raft tips almost vertical for a moment.

	They regroup, balancing.  Brody draws in for another try.

				   BRODY
		   Two at a time...easy...be careful...

				   SIDEBURNS
		   It's okay, it's gone.

	They look around, guessing how their weight is distributed.

				   ANDY
			   (pointing to Reeves
			   and Sideburns)
		   You two better go first.

	Very gingerly, they start to get down.  Reeves is pale.
	Every breath hurts his broken ribs...maybe he's dizzy...
	Perilously unsteady on his feet for such a delicate opera-
	tion.  He and Sideburns step out on the canvas framework
	stretched between the pontoons of the half-submerged
	catamaran -- a tentative step, another, the whole framework
	tipping gently as they work their way out.  Reeves slides
	a little -- Sideburns steadies him.  They're wading knee-
	deep.  Another step...another...a few more and they'll be
	to the P.D. Boat...another...


231-A	BRODY									231-A

	reaches for them ---


232	THE HUGE BURNED HEAD							232

	come up right through the canvas, ripping the heavy fabric
	-- hangs up there straining for the boys -- and crashes
	heavily down, shearing the metal framework and pitching the
	boys back onto the "raft."


233	BRODY									233

	circles and comes in for another try...a shower of spray as
	the Shark's tail lashes the boat.  And almost immediately,
	another swipe jars the wreckage...screams....


234	THE SHARK								234

	wheels back and forth between his boat and the sailboats.
	For a moment, Brody is transfixed by his first good look at
	the thing.  Its pale head half-shrouded in scar tissue,
	brushing the sailboats.

	Some of the kids are getting desperate.

				   SOMEONE
		   Please -- please -- get us off ---


235	BRODY									235

	comes in fast.  Two are ready on the belly of the chopper,
	he's almost got them when the Shark rams into his boat with
	such driving impact that everyone is stunned.  It's as if it
	has been waiting for this moment to unleash its full power.

	Brody snatches up a lifesaver attached to a coil of line and
	flings it toward the wreckage with all his might -- maybe
	he can tow them -- the ring falls short ---


236	UNDERWATER								236

	The line smacks the surface and lies there like a snake.
	A few yards from the ring, water washes over a half-submerged
	pontoon.  Sideburns' feet wade out on it.  From the depths,
	the Shark is rising.

	A pole enters the water...trying to snag the ring ---


237	SURFACE									237

	Sideburns hooks it and pulls it closer...now he can reach it
	with his hands....

	The Shark bursts up only a few feet away.  He jerks the ring over
	his head...the Shark mustn't get that line.

				   SIDEBURNS
		   Take it -- get it up high -- !

	Andy hauls the line up, stretching it between them and the
	P.D. Boat.  As the line goes taut, the Shark wheels under it
	and back again, as if daring them to proceed.

				   ANDY
			   (calling
			   to Brody)
		   The sandbar -- over there ---

	Brody turns the searchlight to a shallow criss-cross of tiny
	waves washing over a sandbar.  About a hundred yards away.
	It couldn't be more than ankle-deep.


238	BRODY									238

	tries to tow the "raft."  He revs his engine.  A shifting,
	a grinding as the wreckage realigns itself to this new
	force.  Screams of "no" and "stop"...He eases off a
	little but continues cautiously to pull it toward the sandbar.
	The Shark dips and twists, its rhythm more agitated, whipping
	back and forth under the tow-line.


239	SEVENTY-FIVE YARDS							239

	The Kids are all clumped close together now, up high, prayer-
	fully measuring the distance to the sandbar.  Another shift.
	A wire halyard strains taut and snaps, whistling like a whip
	past their ears.


240	FIFTY YARDS								240

	Crash, the Shark hits the sailboats hard -- and circles to
	come in again ---


241	FORTY YARDS								241

	They're drawing closer now --- a thump and heavier spray.


242	THIRTY YARDS								242

	a terrible grinding -- the "raft" scrapes bottom.  Hanging
	far down underneath, like an iceberg, it stops -- twenty-five
	yards from the sandbar.  Brody strains his engine.  A
	tearing.  The whole precarious heap is beginning to come apart.
	He can't get them any closer.  He doesn't know what to do.


243	THE KIDS								243

	have reached the breaking point...so close to safety...

				   BOY
		   Come on!  Pull us in!

				   GIRL
			   (screaming)
		   Please -- please -- take us ---


244	BRODY									244

	lowers himself over the side of the boat.

				   BRODY
		   When I say go, you GO!


245	SEAN									245

	is appalled, nearly biting through his lip.  His father hangs
	there dangling his body in the water.  What's he doing?  Brody
	kicks and splashes.  The Shark turns from the raft and cruises
	in Brody's direction.

				   BRODY
		   GO!!!


246	THE KIDS								246	

	They must go in the water.  They hesitate.


247	BRODY									247

	churning the water, watching the Shark arc toward him.

				   BRODY
		   Go, Godammit, GO!  NOW!


248	KIDS									248

	Three of them slip into the water and swim as silently as
	possible for the sandbar.  Angela, Laura and Doug.

	Shivering in anticipation, the Shark comes straight as Brody.
	He pulls himself up, feet slipping, just as the Shark drives
	its mouth into the side of the boat where he was hanging.

	The Kids are halfway to the sandbar, swimming hard.

	The Shark comes at the boat again, in a rage, battering the
	transom, splintering it -- Then it suddenly stops --

	The swimmers are splashing toward shore.  It's heard them...
	it's turning --

				   BRODY
		   Look out -- it's coming!


249	THE SWIMMERS								249

	splash and scream, swimming blindly toward the sandbar.
	Angela is expecting it any second.  Laura is like a rabbit,
	caught, watching the fin come closer.  Doug grabs her by
	the hair and hauls her up on the sandbar.  Angela crawls up
	on her hands and knees, crying.

	The first three are safe.


250	P.D. BOAT - BRODY							250

	plunges his whole body up and down in the water.  The Shark
	turns back toward him, coming fast --

				   BRODY
		   GO!


251	FIVE MORE KIDS								251

	hit the water and make for the sandbar.


252	THE SHARK								252

	goes under.


253	BRODY									253

	twisting, looking for the Shark, making as much disturbance
	in the water as he can.


254	UNDERWATER								254

	On the surface high above us, the small forms of the five
	swimmers, arms and legs thrashing through the water...The
	Shark rising ---


255	BRODY SPLASHING								255

	A scream -- he sees --


256	THE FIN									256

	appearing in the water behind the swimmers.

				   KATHY
		   Oh God, Oh God!  Oh, GOD....!

				   REEVES
		   IT TOUCHED ME!

	The Kids on the raft are frantic...Pulling himself back up
	on his boat, Brody staggers toward the controls.


257	UNDERWATER								257

	Reeves is swimming madly, the Shark nosing his legs.  It
	nuzzles the scarred side of its head along his torso,
	scraping it raw.  It turns and brushes Kathy with the entire
	length of its sandpaper back.


258	SURFACE - KATHY								258

	her face deadly white, shrieks in panic and pain.


259	UNDERWATER - THE SHARK							259

	comes up beneath them for another pass.  It presses its giant
	snout deep into Reeves' belly, testing his soft vital organs,
	smelling, savoring --


260	REEVES									260

	screams as if he's dying.  Another pass by the Shark, a
	glimpse of Kathy's raw chest, and Brody rams the Shark with
	the prow of his boat, driving right up onto its back.  A flick
	of its tail and it's gone.


261	THE SANDBAR								261

	The boys pull Kathy and Reeves up, raw, but intact.  Eight
	are safe.  Brody turns his spotlight ---


262	THE "RAFT"								262

	Three remain:  Sideburns, Andy -- and Sean, whimpering with
	fear, rocking now with each blow as the enraged Shark,
	returning to finish off the "raft," is battering, ripping,
	breaking it apart.  The boys hang on as the much-reduced
	wreckage is destroyed from under them.  The monster heaves
	upward through it, pitching Sideburns into a jagged pipe-end
	of the catamaran's framework, and shearing off two boats.


263	BRODY - P.D. BOAT							263

	heading toward them.


264	THE THREE								264

	Sideburns is bleeding.  Very little holds them now -- and
	with another blow, they're thrown into the water.

	Brody has Sean, he's hauling him onto the boat, hugging him...
	Andy is swimming for the sandbar...


265	SIDEBURNS								265

	is in the water.  Brody hurls him a lifesaver ring...Sideburns
	swims for all he's worth, reaching for it -- and suddenly, he's
	being propelled toward it.

				   SIDEBURNS
			   (staring at Brody)
		   BRODY -- !

	One arm waving, hanging onto the life-line with the other,
	still being propelled, he's being shaken.  He twists the line
	around his arm.

				   SIDEBURNS
			   (hoarsely)
		   PULL UP -- PULL UP!!

	Brody pulls against a great opposing force.  He's not able to
	pull him in...then something gives ---

	His mouth open with horror, Brody continues to pull Sideburns
	up...but only half of him.  His torso, severed at the waist,
	is pouring blood into the water.  And right behind him,
	following the stream of blood --


266	THE HUGE BURNED HEAD							266

	open-jawed. black eyes catching the spotlight, worse than
	any dream, it rises up in Brody's face.  Bloody spray flies.
	Brody goes wild.  The dragging rake.  He grabs it.  Out of
	control now, beyond reason, he brings the metal rake crashing
	down.  It glances off the marble skin.  The Shark hits the
	gunnel a sledge-hammer thud.  Water pours in.  Brody chops at
	the Shark, again, it bounces off.  In a blinding rage, he hurls
	the rake with all his strength at the Shark's head...and
	catches it in the eye.

	Brody is ecstatic as the giant struggles to get free of the
	"hook," then to his horror finds the boat's being pulled along
	swiftly in the water, stripping line from the winch.


267	THE SHARK								267

	is fleeing with the rake embedded in its head.  It twists and
	shakes, but the metal claw sinks deeper.


268	BRODY AND SEAN								268

	drawn along behind, their boat taking water as it careens
	through the waves.  Sean clings to something and it suddenly
	inflates around him, mashing him into the transom.  The rubber
	Res-Q-Raft.


269	THE SHARK								269

	rises into the air, shakes to free itself of the thing...and
	sounds.  Black waves cover its going.


270	THE P.D. BOAT								270

	stops.  The line goes slack.  The Shark doesn't come up.

				   SEAN
		   Where is it?  Is it gone?

	The fog is lifting.  In the distance, the lights of Amity
	twinkle like stars.


271	BRODY									271

	operates the winch.  It comes up slowly...something very
	heavy on it.  Dead weight...the Shark is dead, it must be
	that.  Coming...coming up...it's pulling the boat down.  The
	water's over Brody's knees now.  Sean clings to the rubber
	raft.  It's almost up...now it's surfacing, pulling the
	already swamped boat down further.

	Brody swivels the searchlight, leans out to see what's coming
	up, holding his breath...to his alarm, it's the electrical
	cable caught in the teeth of the rake.  It's pulling the boat
	under!  He tries to stop the winch, but he can't.  It strains
	and burns with the weight of its load.

	He forces the controls, they jam and strip, the winch goes
	into high, spinning the cable up out of the water, whirling
	the rake at the top, snagging there, and stopping --


272	THE P.D. BOAT								272

	is level with the waves, the six-inch high-powered electric
	cable from the mainland draped like an enormous snake over the
	back of the boat.  Brody tries to lift it off.  And there, a
	a distance from the boat --


273	THE SHARK SURFACES							273

	The boat is settling deeper in the water.  The searchlight
	shorts out.  Darkness.  The Shark moves slowly toward them.
	No need to hurry.


274	BRODY									274

	hammers at the cable, can't get it off.  He splashes the
	cockpit -- a few cylinders cough to life, he jams a lever,
	the boat strains against the cable, engine noises rise to a
	shriek, and stop.  They're caught.


275	THE GREAT WHITE								275

	swims slowly in a wide circle.

	The boat is level with the water, and the rubber raft drifts
	away from it, attached by only a rope.  Sean splashes toward
	it and climbs in.  Brody's mind is racing.

	A flick of its tail and the Shark turns in.

	Too frightened to scream, Sean watches the white body slide
	languorously through the water toward them.


276	THE FIN									276

	crosses in front of Sean...so close...in front of his face...
	higher than the raft...enormous.  Brody screams...he would
	kill the thing with his hands...it hits the boat with the
	force of a comet, and with a great lunge, hurls itself onto
	the sinking deck, mouth open, its bloody eye a lurid pit.  A
	terrible grinding snap as the teeth just miss Brody's legs ---
	he falls back gasping, eyes riveted.  Beating its tail, the
	Shark comes across the boat after him.  Brody splashes madly
	for the rubber raft.


277	THE SHARK								277

	plunges into the water and disappears.


278	BRODY'S HANDS								278

	tear at the rope holding the rubber raft...the knot's too
	tight.  Sean screams.  Twenty yards away, the fin surfaces and
	slips like a blade through the black waves toward them.


279	BRODY									279

	jumps into the rubber raft with Sean...they're trapped!  Now,
	picking up speed, the Shark beats its way in for the kill.


280	BRODY									280

	on an impulse, grabs the cable with both hands and pulls the
	raft behind it.


281	THE CABLE								281

	is the only thing between them and death.  Beyond it, its
	frenzy peaking, the ravenous beast devours everything in its
	path...only the cable stands between it and the thing it wants.

				   BRODY
			   (a flash of
			   realization)
		   Come on -- come on --


282	THE JAWS OPEN WIDE							282

	reach and strain for Brody -- and close like a great steel
	gate on the cable, biting deep --


283	THE GREAT WHITE								283

	rises up on its tail, thrashing and vibrating as 60,000 volts
	tear through it.


284	THE CABLE								284

	twists and whips as spasms wrack the creature.  Sheets of
	electrical fire roll down its enormous body.


285	BRODY AND SEAN								285

	cleave to each other safe in their rubber raft, as sparks
	shower around them.


286	THE SHARK								286

	Aglow, brilliantly lit against the night sky, dancing on its
	tail.  In the distance, the lights of Amity dim, and die.


287	UNDERWATER								287

	The Great White drifts silently down into the darkness.


288	A STAR									288

	streaks across the sky, hangs like a jewel for a moment, and
	fades over --


289	THE RUBBER RAFT								289

	Sean weeps in his father's arms.  Then, smiling to himself,
	Brody reaches for the oar, and slowly begins to paddle toward
	the sandbar.  The Kids are cheering.  Sean, tears streaming
	down his face, gallantly waves to them.

				   BRODY
		   Finally got your brother to take
		   you sailing, didn't you?

				   SEAN
		   They made me come.




					THE END
