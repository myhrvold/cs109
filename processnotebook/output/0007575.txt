    	fast in the grip of a horrible witchcraft delusion. 
    	Hundreds suffered persecution, young and old, rich 
    	and poor, no one was safe. In Salem, alone, 19 people 
    	were hanged before the Governor's Proclamation put an 
    	end to this folly.

    	calling. A little girl of 8 or 9, plainly terrified  
    	of the dark, runs into the picture, clutches 
    	Suzette's arms, and points to closed door. As Suzette 
    	looks toward it VISION rises on door of miniature 
    	devils and witches, some (if possible) holding door 
    	handle, others threatening with pitchforks and 
    	broomsticks. (At least 2 devils and 2 witches.) 
    	Suzette waves her hand towards them as though 
    	brushing them aside and VISION FADES. As door opens 
    	slowly and Suzette and the child stand illumined by 
    	lantern light and the light from the house, Suzette 
    	smiles at the child and says, "There, you see! There 
    	are no devils or witches!" As they move to go within

    	_LIVING ROOM--(COLONIAL COTTAGE) (DAY)_
    	(Hereafter designated as Suzette's Cottage.) (Big
    	fireplace, small lattice window, simple table and 
    	chairs of heavy colonial structure, a heavy wooden 
    	settle near fireplace.)  (For full description of 
    	fireplace refer to Scene 133.) (Very little in the 
    	room. No pictures on the walls in this scene.) Old
    	Struble enters, looking about him, rubbing his hands. 
    	Man comes in with bundle on his shoulder. (This means 
    	household goods tied up in table cover or shawl. When 
    	box is mentioned later in scene I mean the wooden 
    	boxes or chests which served as trunks in those 
    	days.)  Man throws bundle down in middle of floor and 
    	goes out. Another man, passing him with big wooden 
    	box on shoulder, sets it down and also goes out. As he 
    	does so, Suzette enters, cloaked and dressed as though 
    	having been on a journey. She has her arms about her 
    	mother.  Suzette, with very daughterly affectionate 
    	manner, leads her mother tenderly out of the picture 
    	toward the wooden settle in front of the fireplace.
    
    			Scene 6 
    
    	_THE SETTEE--(LIVING ROOM) (SEMI-CLOSE-UP)_
    	Suzette and mother enter the picture. Suzette places
    	the mother on the settle, takes her own cloak and 
    	makes a pillow of it. Is asking her mother if she is 
    	feeling very ill, when old Struble comes into the 
    	picture. The mother is speaking to Suzette. Struble's 
    	face shows that he does not understand. He turns to
    	the girl and asks her a question.  Suzette nods, says:
     
    9	SPOKEN TITLE: WE ARE FROM THE FRENCH SETTLEMENT. MY 
    	MOTHER SPEAKS ONLY FRENCH BUT I SPEAK THE ENGLISH. 
    
    	Smiles up at Struble, who nods gravely, looking at 
    	the girl, gloatingly, noting how pretty she is, and 
    	his claw-like hand stretches out toward her, as he 
    	notes the little knitted purse she holds in her hand. 
    	Suzette looks at him a moment in surprise, and then 
    	as he indicates "The rent in advance," she smiles, 
    	opens the purse and puts the money in his hand. 
    	Indicates to Struble that her mother is tired and he 
    	must go. Struble bows and goes out of the picture 
    	with a glance first at the money and then at Suzette. 
    	Suzette kisses her mother's cheek, tells her she must 
    	go out and see to the rest of their goods. The mother 
    	smiles feebly, and nods. Suzette turns and goes out 
    	of the picture.

    	_STREET--(OUTSIDE OF SUZETTE'S COTTAGE)_
     	Old Struble going away from cottage up street, meets 
    	Richard Wayne (in civilian's clothes) coming down 
    	street towards cottage. Wayne salutes his guardian, 
    	who indicates the cottage, and says:
     
    10	SPOKEN TITLE: THE NEW TENANTS HAVE ARRIVED. THEY ARE 
    	FOREIGNERS. 
    
    	Wayne indicates: "Is that so?" Doesn't seem 
    	particularly interested. The old man shows the money. 
    	Wayne smiles and goes down the street toward the
    	cottage as Struble goes toward his home in opposite
    	direction.

    	another chest or trunk, and bring it into the house.
    	Several of the villagers, young men, women, and little 
    	children standing near gate, eyeing her--among them
    	Nokomis, basket of berries on arm, stops and looks at 
    	the girl. Suzette sees her and the basket, and

    	_EXTERIOR SUZETTE'S COTTAGE--(CLOSE-UP)_ 
    	Nokomis and Suzette. Suzette indicates to Nokomis

    	and Suzette says:
     
    11 	SPOKEN TITLE: MY MOTHER IS ILL. I WILL PAY THE GOOD 
    	MONEY IF YOU WILL HELP ME.
     
    	Nokomis grunts and indicates that she will do so.

    	_EXTERIOR  SUZETTE'S COTTAGE--(FULL VIEW)_
    	The villagers whispering to each other. One of the 
    	men, pointing to the cottage which Suzette and 
    	Nokomis are entering, says:
     
    12 	SPOKEN TITLE: A WITCH AND A FOREIGNER GO WELL TOGETHER.
    
    	The people look at him in fear when he says witch. 
    	Wayne comes into the picture. One of the men detaining 
    	him, begins to talk to him. Some of the children start 
    	to move away.
     
    			Scene 11 
    
    	_THE SETTEE--(LIVING ROOM  SUZETTE'S COTTAGE)_
    	Suzette's mother stretched out on settle, rigid. 
    	Suzette enters picture, looks at her. The mother 
    	begins to cry aloud and toss herself about. She looks 
    	frightened. The Indian woman comes into the picture, 
    	points at the mother, strokes her head, looking at 
    	the girl keenly, and motions toward the door, starts 
    	to go. Suzette looks frightened, grabs the Indian 
    	woman by the arm, appeals to her. The Indian woman 
    	says something again, looking keenly at the mother, 
    	indicates: "They will say she is a witch."  Suzette
    	shakes her head vehemently, indicates "No, _no!_" Then 
    	says:
     
    13	SPOKEN TITLE: HELP ME. WE CAME HERE BECAUSE IN THE 
    	FRENCH SETTLEMENT THEY BEGAN TO CALL HER A WITCH. 
    
    	The Indian woman looks down at the girl, then at the
     	mother. Takes pity on them, remembering that she too
    	is called a witch. Feels bond between her and the
    	pretty white girl, Suzette. Nodding her head, 
    	indicates, "All right."   
     
    14	SPOKEN TITLE: I TELL SHE SICK. I BRING MEDICINE.
    
     	Turns and goes out of the picture, nodding her head. 
    	Suzette goes to her mother, begins chafing her hands 
    	and calling to her. As her mother stops moaning and 
    	begins to scream, Suzette looks frightened, puts her
    	hand over her mother's mouth, then looks about her, 
    	and goes hurriedly out of the picture.

    15 	SPOKEN TITLE: HOW SHOULD I KNOW WHETHER THE MAID BE 
    	PRETTY? I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.
    
    	One of the young men laughs and points toward window.

    	Suzette and her mother--the mother reviving. She 
    	clutches Suzette feverishly and says: "What did I 
    	say?  Did any one hear me?" Suzette putting her arm 
    	about her, reassures her, says:
     
    16	SPOKEN TITLE: YOU ARE SAFE HERE. THOUGH YOU CALL ON 
    	GOD WHEN YOU RAVE, NO ONE WILL UNDERSTAND. 
    
    	The mother's fear fades out of her face. She pats her 
    	daughter's hand and asks if she is sure. Suzette nods 
    	and says she is. Tells her mother not to worry, it

    	books, a big desk, chairs, ledger, and writing 
    	material. The furniture in this room is not ornate--
    	very plain and old, but not poor looking. The rest of 
    	Struble's house is very prosperous looking.) Struble, 
    	counting money, looks up, hearing someone, hastily 
    	conceals the money. Wayne comes in, asks his guardian 
    	for money. Struble does not want to give it to him, 
    	says:
     
    17 	SPOKEN TITLE: I'LL NOT GIVE YOU MONEY TO SQUANDER IN 
    	BOSTON. I'M YOUR GUARDIAN UNTIL YOU'RE TWENTY-FIVE.

    	himself out of the room, indicating that when he is

    	Suzette, on her knees beside the rabbit, looks at it 
    	pitifully. Wayne comes into the picture, stoops over, 
    	touches her gently on the shoulder. She turns and 
    	looks up at him, recognizing him. Gives a little 
    	smile, showing that she's glad to see him, and that 
    	their friendship has progressed considerably. Then, 
    	looking down at the rabbit, determines to scold him, 
    	and begins to rise, without smiling.

    	attention to the girl herself, watching her closely, 
    	admiringly, but not paying any particular attention 
    	to what she says. Suzette is not really angry, but is 
    	coquettishly pretending anger. She stamps her foot at 
    	him, pointing down to the dead rabbit. Wayne wakes up 
    	with a start to what Suzette says, stoops, reaches 
    	out of picture, the girl staring at him.  He comes 
    	back, straightens himself up, rabbit in his hand. 
    	Drops it in his game bag. As he does this, Suzette 
    	covers her face with her hands. Wayne takes her

    	RABBIT--TO-DAY.

    	asks her where she is going. She indicates the woods, 
    	telling him she is going to see the Indian woman and

    	Suzette, embarrassed, pulls her hand away,

    	witch, shakes her head, telling her she must not say 
    	that. Takes basket of berries and herbs and rushes 
    	from hut. Nokomis smiles, shakes her head, indicating: 
    	"That's the way with girls--you tell them what they 
    	want to hear and they pretend they don't want to hear 
    	it." Smiling and mumbling, goes toward fireplace.

    	hearing her, instantly changes his attitude, turns 
    	around with an innocent expression as though he saw 
    	nothing but blue sky, and pretends to be examining 
    	his gun. Suzette comes up to him, scolds him, tells 
    	him that he was going to break his promise. Wayne 
    	smiles at her, says:
    
    21 	SPOKEN TITLE: I SAID RABBITS, NOT BIRDS.

    	shrinks away from the gun, indignantly clings to the 
    	basket, indicates that he has enough with his old gun 
    	and gamebag. They go off together, Suzette still 
    	pretending to scold him, Wayne smiling as though he

    	about her and kisses her. Suzette, at first 
    	frightened--looks up at him, hides her head on his 
    	shoulder. Wayne indicates: "Now, will you let me 
    	come with you?" Suzette shakes her head, indicating:

    	feet and hands twisting. She is muttering. (Note: Not
    	an epileptic fit--more the effect of a bad heart or 
    	some serious brain trouble.) Suzette, frightened, 
    	reaches for pitcher on table--pours water in glass--
    	begins to sprinkle on mother's face. As she does so,
    	Struble comes into picture. Suzette looks up at him 
    	frightened--puts her hand over her mother's mouth. 
    	Then concludes that this is useless. Struble looks
    	shocked. As he looks at the mother, says: "Devil's 
    	Latin!" Suzette shakes her head, angry--says 
    	scornfully:
     
    27 	SPOKEN TITLE: SHE SPEAKS FRENCH. NOT DEVIL'S LATIN.

    	threat to make her do what he desires. Suzette begs 
    	him to help her, and together they half lift, half
    	support the mother out of the picture.

    	Looks at Struble for sympathy and righteous 
    	indignation at the very thought of them suspecting 
    	her mother. Old Struble purses up his mouth--nods his 
    	head solemnly and points outside--says:
     
    29 	SPOKEN TITLE: THEY SUSPECT HER HERE. BUT I WILL BE 
    	YOUR FRIEND. 
    
    	Suzette horrified, implores him to help her--begins 
    	to cry. He pats her shoulder with his bony hand--
    	starts to draw her to him, but the girl involuntarily 
    	draws back. Struble realizes he has gone as far as he 
    	can this time--pats her shoulder again--chucks her 
    	under the chin--tells her to be a good girl, and he 
    	will take care of her. Goes off smiling and chuckling 
    	to himself at his diplomacy. The girl stands looking 
    	after him in horrified amazement--then as he goes out 
    	of the picture, she bursts into tears, turns and goes 
    	out of the picture toward bedroom.

    	tells him that he must not--that the mother is ill 
    	and the girl anxious--indicates that he has something 
    	to say to him--anxious to get Wayne away from Suzette,

    	startled, goes to him--asks if anything is wrong.  He 
    	asks her how her mother is this morning, indicating 
    	the bedroom.  Suzette begs him to tell her what to do 
    	for her mother.  Old Makepeace shakes his head--
    	indicates he doesn't know--it's a pretty serious 
    	matter. She'll undoubtedly be named as a witch.  The 
    	girl, frantic, indicates what can she do--her mother 
    	is too ill to move.   Old Struble, who has been 
    	gloating over her, adjusts his ruffles, and says, 
    	leaning over her, taking her by the wrists:
     
    39	SPOKEN TITLE: MARRY ME AT ONCE. I AM A MAN OF

    	The girl, simply overwhelmed at such an idea, starts

    	to marry him.  The old man turns away--indicates that 
    	that's all right if she doesn't care what becomes of 
    	her mother.  The girl, unhappy and frightened, 
    	stretches out her hand.  He seizes it, and bends over 
    	it.  As he does this she draws away.  He tells her
    	there's no one else.  Says to her that she needn't 
    	count on Wayne--he's gone and left her.  Indicates 
    	that she's helpless unless he helps her.  VISION OF 
    	Captain Wayne rises--Wayne sitting at table in full 
    	regimentals, drinking with one of his brother 
    	officers (not drunk).  Wayne seems, in the vision, 
    	utterly gay and careless and to have forgotten all 
    	about Suzette. As she starts, putting her hand on her 
    	heart, VISION fades--and old Struble who is holding 
    	her hand again, begins to plead his cause.  The girl 
    	in a quick revulsion of feeling throws his hand aside 
    	and tells him that she will not marry him.  Old 
    	Struble turns on her threateningly--storms--points 
    	toward bedroom door, and indicates it will go hard 
    	with her mother. VISION arises either on stone

    	steps together, Struble puts his hand on the necklace 
    	to look at it, disguising: the action with an attempt 
    	at caress.  Suzette involuntarily starts away from 
    	him, so violently that the necklace unclasps in his 
    	hands.  Struble and his wife face each other.  An

    	GUARDIAN'S WIFE ABOUT--THIS WAY.
    
    	Wayne thinks she is posing--listens to her with an 
    	amused smile--begins to laugh, and before Suzette
    	is aware of his intention, takes her in his arms.  
    	Suzette frees herself--tells him angrily:

    	Richard, impressed in spite of himself, looks at her

    	to answer him.  Richard, ashamed of himself, bows his

    	_FIREPLACE--LIVING ROOM--(CLOSE-UP)_
     	(A good picture of exactly the kind of fireplace 
    	desired is shown on p. 79 of "Colonial Days," by 
    	Wilbur F. Gords.  This fireplace is very deep--has 
    	seat on inside of fireplace, along one side.  If 
    	practicable would like the VISIONS to be shown 
    	against the blackened back of the fireplace, a little 
    	above the fire line so that the fire, low, not 
    	blazing, would be burning beneath the VISION.  If 
    	this is not practicable, can arrange that the VISION 
    	fall in another place in mantel above fireplace--but 
    	the fireback would be most effective.)  The three 
    	small children sitting on the long seat inside 
    	fireplace, their little bowl of mush and milk in 
    	their laps, eating. The oldest child comes into the 
    	picture--takes little stool in front of fire and sits 
    	down with her back partly turned to camera, facing 
    	her sisters and brothers. They ask her where she's 
    	been.  She glances over her shoulder to see that none 
    	of the grown-ups are about, listening, leans forward 
    	and points mysteriously at the fireback. VISION rises 
    	there of the interior of Nokomis' hut in which 
    	Nokomis goes through the same motions that she did 
    	when she was putting the meat and vegetables into the 
    	stew--Suzette standing beside her, also; _but as the_ 
    	_child tells it_, Nokomis is a terrible, impossible old 
    	witch with a pointed cap and a long hooked nose and 
    	claw fingers. Likewise what she drops into the stew 
    	is not meat and vegetables but toads, little snakes 
    	or long worms--dead birds with all their feathers on, 
    	and a kitten or two.  Suzette is also a witch, but 
    	not so ugly, and a talisman she fingers, instead of 
    	being composed of beads is a little skull--the eyes
    	gleaming like pinpoints of fire (If this is possible 
    	to get over). Instead of a black cat, a little devil 
    	with horns and a tail, is watching the two.  VISION 
    	FADES OUT. The children are horror-stricken--unable 
    	to eat, but the oldest one keeps on talking and 
    	points again to the fireplace.  Another VISION rises 
    	of Nokomis going up the chimney astride of a 
    	broomstick. Suzette and the little devil follow her 
    	in the same manner. As the child tells this and the 
    	VISION FADES OUT, the youngest child screams and 
    	drops her bowl of mush and milk, commences to tremble 
    	and twitch and scream with fright.

    	been bewitched. The other children clutch her skirts
    	as she stops to comfort her.  The child who has been
    	the cause of all this is frightened as the rest, but 
    	stubbornly answers the neighbor woman, insisting that 
    	she did see it and that it was just as she said.

    	_LIVING ROOM--STRUBLE HOUSE_
     	Suzette comes in, sinks down into easy-chair,

    	enters picture and commences to rail at her, accuses 
    	her of having allowed Wayne to make love to her, 
    	strikes her with his stick.  Suzette, indignant, 
    	thrusts him back, denounces him for his cruelty to 
    	her.  She is hysterical and as she points to him with 
    	one hand and touches her talisman with her other hand, 
    	she says:
     
    59 	SPOKEN TITLE: WICKED OLD MAN--YOU BRING PEOPLE 
    	NOTHING BUT UNHAPPINESS. YOU WOULD BE BETTER--DEAD! 
    
    	The old man is astonished.  This is the first time 
    	Suzette has ever turned on him.  He is a little 
    	frightened, too, and pointing to the talisman, asks 
    	her what it is. Suzette, seeing his superstitious 
    	fear, plays on it, and answers him mysteriously.
     
    60 	SPOKEN TITLE: I WEAR IT BECAUSE IT GRANTS ME--ALL MY 
    	WISHES. 
    
    	Shaking with fear, the old man goes out of the

    	looking down at the talisman, wondering if she has 
    	found a way to keep him off.

    	his belt, comes to Nokomis' door. Listens a moment,
    	knocks and enters.  (Note: This boy must be very

    	and Struble come into the picture.  Suzette greets 
    	minister, motioning to chair.  The minister sits and 
    	addresses Suzette almost as though she were a 
    	prisoner at the bar.  Suzette astonished--doesn't 
    	understand. He commences to accuse her--Suzette 
    	understands now, says firmly:
     
    62 	SPOKEN TITLE: I DO NOT BELIEVE IN WITCHES OR DEVILS.
    
    	Struble and the minister horrified.  Struble so 
    	worked up that he shakes his fist at her, begins to 
    	scream and rave, falls forward in sort of a fit.  The 
    	minister and Suzette catch him before he falls out of 
    	the picture, putting him in chair.  Suzette bends over

    	tomahawk in belt.  Nokomis is helping him put paint 
    	on his cheeks.  She is talking to him as she does so 
    	eagerly.  Her manner is that of a grown person
    	humoring a child who is playing a game seriously. 
    	Nokomis gathers something from what he says, leans
     	forward alertly, and asks him a question.   The boy
    	answers, sticks tomahawk in belt and holds up two
    	fingers.  Nokomis looks alarmed, asks him again.  He
    	replies in the same manner, then indicates that she 
    	is to keep the clothes he has taken off for him.  
    	Nokomis throws them on a pile of blankets and 
    	garments in corner.  Indian boy grunts, indicates

    	her, won't take it until the mother of the little 
    	child (Scene 132) acting as nurse, comes--takes it,

     	(These taverns were the place of meeting for the best 
    	people in town, and the tavern need not be shown full 
    	of loafers--they were the only meeting places where 
    	the godly as well as the ungodly could get 
    	refreshments.) Soldiers, civilians, eating and 
    	drinking--not very many of them in sight.  Suzette 
    	comes on--travel-stained, worn, and weary,--just as a 
    	town drunkard is being admonished by a portly 
    	gentleman who is pointing him out with his stick.  
    	The tavern keeper, with many apologies, is directing 
    	his hostler to remove him.  Suzette dodges the town 
    	drunkard and rushes into the portly gentleman.  He 
    	takes her by the ear and threatens her with his cane.  
    	She dodges from under his grasp and runs to the 
    	tavern keeper who takes her by the arm and is about 
    	to send her flying as a boy and a nuisance, when she 
    	looks up at him--puts her finger to her lips, and 
    	says:

    	and puts his hand on hers, his face showing how much 
    	he appreciates what she has done, and all he would 
    	like to say to her.  Suzette draws her hand away, 
    	indicating that he must be careful.  He looks around 
    	him carefully, recognizing the need for caution, 
    	unless he would expose her to insult.  They turn and
