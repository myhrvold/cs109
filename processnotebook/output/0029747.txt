>     FADE IN on a long shot of a

>     prairie road.  To the theme song

>     of Laurel and Hardy we see a

>     travois, draws by a burro, which

>     Stan is leading.  Seated on the

>     travois is Babe.

>      _

>      19. _

>     IN A CLOSER SHOT we see that

>     Babe is asleep.  We follow the

>     travois to a stream, which Stan

>     fords, leading the burro.

>      20. _

>     As they come out on the other

>     side of the stream we see that

>     the shafts have pulled loose from

>     the travois, leaving Babe still

>     seated on it, in the water.

>     Stan continues out of scene, not

>     noticing that he has left Babe

>     behind.

>      _

>      21. _

>     CUT TO BABE.  Feeling the water

>     around his fanny he wakes up and

>     has a takem when he realizes what

>     has happened.  He whistles to Stan.

>      _

>      22. _

>     CUT TO STAN hearing Babe's whistle.

>     He comes to a stop, looks around,

>     then returns to Babe.

>                                   STAN:       What happened?

>      _

>      23. _

>     Babe starts to wade ashore, but

>     steps into a deep hole and dis-

>     appears.  Stan misses him and

>     starts to brush through the water

>     trying to find him.  Babe's head

>     comes out of the water.  Stan assists

>     him to the bank, and they exit

>     out of the scene.

>      24. _

>     CUT TO a cross-roads where we

>     see a sign post reading:

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>     The sign is loose on the post,

>     so that it swings with the wind.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>     Babe and Stan enter with the

>     burro.  Babe looks at the sign;

>     it is pointing to the left.  He

>     turns and looks off in that

>     direction.

>      _

>      25. _

>     The wind shifts the sign.  Stan

>     looks up at it and it is now

>     pointing to the right.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>     They both start off in different

>     directions, and a controversy

>     arises as to the right road.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>                                   BABE:       This is the way!

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>                                    STAN:      Uh,uh.  It's this way.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>                                   BABE:       Can't you read?  We

>                                               have to go the way

>                                               that sign points.

>      _

>      26. _

>     This argument culminates when

>     they both look at the sign and

>     see that it has now swung back

>     in the direction from which they

>     came.  As they look at the sign

>     it swings again.  They realize

>     what is wrong, but are left very

>     much in doubt as to the right

>     direction to Brushwood Gulch.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>                                   BABE:       Now we don't know which

>                                               way to go.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>                                   STAN:       Let's go this way.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>                                   BABE:       Why should we go that

>                                               way, when it might be

>                                               this way?

>      _

>      27. _

>     This puzzles Stan for a moment.

>     An Indian Brave enters the scene.

>     Stan walks over to him.

>                                   STAN:       Pardon me, Mister, but

>                                               which way is right?

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>     The indian grunts and points

>     to the right, then exits out

>     of scene.  Stan turns to Babe,

>     very satisfied.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>                                   STAN:       You see, I was right.

>                                               It's that way.

>                                   SHERIFF:    Whoa!

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>     He speaks to someone out of

>                                   SHERIFF:    Where you headed for,

>      _

>     CUT TO REVERSE SHOT of Stan

>                                   BABE:       We're on our way to

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>                                   SHERIFF:    Well, you'll never get

>                                               there that way, because

>                                               it's _that_ way.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>     He indicates the other road.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>                                   BABE:       Thank you very much.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>     The sheriff continues on his

>     way out of scene.  Babe gives

>     Stan a dirty look.

>                                   BABE:       You see how dumb you

>                                               are?  I don't believe

>                                               you even know that

>                                               Lincoln is dead.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>                                   STAN:       I certainly do.  I knew

>                                               it a week ago.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>                                   BABE:       Well, you didn't know

>                                               it was _that_ way.

>      _

>      32. _

>     CUT BACK to Babe.  He straightens

>     that he has been shot.  Babe

>     assumes a very dramatic position

>     on the ground, groaning like a

>     dying man.

>                                   BABE:       To think my best friend

>                                               would shoot me - right

>                                               behind my back.

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>     Suddenly the sheriff's voice

>     interrupts sharply from out of

>     scene.

>                                   SHERIFF:    Stick 'em up!

>     &nbsp_place_holder;

>     Babe forgets all about dying,

>     jumps to his feet and holds

>     up his hands.  Stan does like-

>     wise.  The sheriff steps into the

>     scene with his gun drawn, and

>     throws his punctured hat on the

>     ground.

>                                   SHERIFF:    Take a look at that

>                                               hat you big, bloated

>                                               porcupine!

>      _
